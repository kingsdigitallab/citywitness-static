								<p>Old Castle is no longer visible but was the site of Swansea&rsquo;s first castle, built in around 1100. The castle itself was a motte and bailey, covering quite a large site and connected on one side to the market place and Wind Street. The castle was enclosed on all four sides by natural defences, but these were also strengthened by walls and gates. It is possible that the outer part of the castle enclosure, the bailey, was used to control traffic coming into and out of the market place, passing before the lord&rsquo;s eyes. If there was a town at Swansea before the Normans, their castle may have been built upon house-plots and streets, as happened elsewhere at this time, at Norwich for example. By-passing the castle was made possible by using Goat Street, which skirts to the west of the castle, or Strand to the east, avoiding the lord&rsquo;s prying eyes.</p>

								<p>Yr Hen Gastell oedd lleoliad castell cyntaf Abertawe, a sefydlwyd tua 1106. Roedd yn gastell mwnt a beili, sydd bellach wedi diflannu o'r treflun modern. Pan gafodd ei adeiladu, byddai'r castell wedi bod yn symbol o bŵer Normanaidd yn nhirlun Cymru. Rhannwyd y castell yn ddwy ran, sef wardiau neu feil&iuml;au, gyda ffos a phalis o goed ar gyfer yr amddiffynfeydd a dau borth. Roedd un porth ar ochr ogleddol y castell, yn arwain at y Stryd Fawr, a'r llall ar yr ochr ddeheuol, gyferbyn &acirc;'r Castell Newydd. Roedd ward allanol yr Hen Gastell yn cynnwys nifer o'r adeiladau yr oedd eu hangen i'w gynnal a'i gadw. Y ward fewnol oedd calon amddiffynnol y castell gyda'i wal ei hun a ffos o amgylch twmpath (mwnt) pridd a thŵr ar ei ben. Ym 1216 roedd y castell dan reolaeth y teulu de Braose, ac ym 1221 atgyweiriodd John de Braose y castell a'i ailadeiladu mewn carreg. Ym 1845, darganfuwyd gweddillion hen borth y Stryd Fawr o'r 13eg ganrif a datgelwyd adeilad trawiadol gyda dau dŵr bob ochr i'r fynedfa. Mewn blynyddoedd diweddarach mae archaeolegwyr hefyd wedi dod o hyd i rannau o ffos y castell ger Stryd y Coleg a Ffordd y Dywysoges.</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Here, in what is probably the oldest part of Swansea, was the town&rsquo;s main market place. The site was close to the castle and the power of the Anglo-Norman lords. Food, clothes and other goods would have been traded here. One of the witnesses to the hanging of William Cragh has the name Henry Skinner, which suggests that he may have been involved in the local leather trade. It&rsquo;s possible that other places were also used for trading and occasional markets. The Welshman John ap Hywel tells us that he watched the hanging of William Cragh from a &lsquo;platea&rsquo; (an open space or square) by St Mary&rsquo;s Church. This may have been the open area just outside the Wassail Gate, near St Mary&rsquo;s, which has many features typical of market places in medieval towns. This may have been an alternative market place used by the local Welsh community.</p>

									<p><p>This coin may well have changed hands in Swansea&rsquo;s marketplace, located at the upper end of Wind Street. Goods of all kinds were sold here, and the trade in hides and leather goods was particularly important in medieval Swansea. A late 12th-century charter granted to the burgesses by William de Beaumont included a clause banning foreign merchants from selling cloth in Swansea or buying skins from anyone other than citizens of the town. This was a way of protecting and supporting the local economy.</p></p>
