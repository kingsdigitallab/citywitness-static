								<p>At the same time as the area around St Mary&rsquo;s Church was developed, it is likely too that High Street became built-up north of the castle. High Street was the main land route into the town, and led right up to the castle gates and Old Castle. The street was a suburb in the thirteenth century and it extended northwards for some considerable distance. The street was wide and could have been used for trading, and certainly its position as a main route in the town would have meant properties a long it would have been desirable as sites for shops and merchants&rsquo; houses. When High Street was first built up, perhaps in the early-13th century, perhaps earlier, it was not defended, but later, by the 14th century the town&rsquo;s walls cut across High Street at King Street, dividing the suburb in two, creating High Street and Upper High Street. A gate was built across the street too, North Gate.</p>

								<p>Y Stryd Fawr oedd y brif ffordd i Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol o'r gogledd. Roedd yn llwybr pwysig ac yn stryd hir gyda thai; roedd rhai yn y dref gaerog gyda rhai eraill y tu allan, ym maestref y dref ganoloesol. Y Porth Gogleddol oedd yn eu rhannu. Mae'n debygol y sefydlwyd y Stryd Fawr ar ddiwedd y 12fed ganrif wrth i Abertawe ffynnu a thyfu'r tu hwnt i ardal y dref Normanaidd gynharach a oedd o gwmpas Stryd y Gwynt. Er bod Abertawe wedi newid yn sylweddol dros y ddwy ganrif ddiwethaf, mae'n anhygoel bod olion rhai lleiniau o'r Oesoedd Canol wedi goroesi ar y Stryd Fawr, er bod yr adeiladau eu hunain yn rhai modern.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>At the time of the hanging of William Cragh in 1290, the de Briouze family had moved to the New Castle in Swansea (although they preferred to stay at Oystermouth Castle, in modern-day Mumbles). The castles were a symbol of Anglo-Norman power and a target for attacks by Welsh fighters such as William Cragh. The entry for 1113 in the Welsh Chronicle, Brut y Tywysogion, tells how Welsh warriors attacked Swansea&rsquo;s Old Castle &lsquo;and burnt the environs but could not destroy it, only ravaging the land of Gower&rsquo;. William Cragh was hanged for his part in continuing Welsh rebellions against Anglo-Norman rule.</p>

This image is familiar to us from medieval romances and stories, and represents an idealised version of medieval chivalry. Swansea&rsquo;s Old Castle was home to the noble de Briouze family until the later 1280s, but the experience of the de Briouze men here on the Anglo-Norman frontier was probably more about real violence and managing local tensions than elaborate tournaments &nbsp;or pageantry.</span></p></p>
