								<p>At the same time as the area around St Mary&rsquo;s Church was developed, it is likely too that High Street became built-up north of the castle. High Street was the main land route into the town, and led right up to the castle gates and Old Castle. The street was a suburb in the thirteenth century and it extended northwards for some considerable distance. The street was wide and could have been used for trading, and certainly its position as a main route in the town would have meant properties a long it would have been desirable as sites for shops and merchants&rsquo; houses. When High Street was first built up, perhaps in the early-13th century, perhaps earlier, it was not defended, but later, by the 14th century the town&rsquo;s walls cut across High Street at King Street, dividing the suburb in two, creating High Street and Upper High Street. A gate was built across the street too, North Gate.</p>

								<p>Y Stryd Fawr oedd y brif ffordd i Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol o'r gogledd. Roedd yn llwybr pwysig ac yn stryd hir gyda thai; roedd rhai yn y dref gaerog gyda rhai eraill y tu allan, ym maestref y dref ganoloesol. Y Porth Gogleddol oedd yn eu rhannu. Mae'n debygol y sefydlwyd y Stryd Fawr ar ddiwedd y 12fed ganrif wrth i Abertawe ffynnu a thyfu'r tu hwnt i ardal y dref Normanaidd gynharach a oedd o gwmpas Stryd y Gwynt. Er bod Abertawe wedi newid yn sylweddol dros y ddwy ganrif ddiwethaf, mae'n anhygoel bod olion rhai lleiniau o'r Oesoedd Canol wedi goroesi ar y Stryd Fawr, er bod yr adeiladau eu hunain yn rhai modern.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The Hospital of St David was founded after the hanging of William Cragh, in 1332 (Cragh was hanged in 1290). But the values of the Hospital reflect medieval traditions of charity, alms-giving and care for the sick and poor which we also glimpse in the story of William Cragh. Lady Mary de Briouze, wife of the Lord William who orders Cragh&rsquo;s execution, performs acts of charity often associated with medieval noblewomen by sending almond milk and broth to help nourish Cragh after the hanging. There&rsquo;s a fascinating tension here between Mary&rsquo;s duty to support her husband&rsquo;s rule as Marcher lord, and her Christian obligation to support the vulnerable members of Swansea&rsquo;s community.</p>
