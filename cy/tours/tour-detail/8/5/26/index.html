								<p>Swansea had town walls by the middle of the 14th century, built of stone, at least for a part of their length, with gates for the streets in and out. The town walls were not built around the whole of the town but just for the part immediately around the castle area, as if the town walls were really a way of creating an outer set of defences for the New Castle that was also being built at this time (to replace the Old Castle). The town walls cut through High Street, and ran behind house-plots in Goat Street, then along the side of St Mary&rsquo;s Church, to link up with the town ditch that was created to defend the area of Frog Street and Fisher Street to the south. The town gates have all gone, but from archaeological research and by studying the town&rsquo;s street pattern it is possible to work out where the gates were, as well as the circuit of the walls.</p>

								<p>Roedd Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol yn dref gaerog. Mae'r enw Whitewalls yn atgof rhannol o'r llinell o waliau a oedd yn rhedeg ar ochr orllewinol (mewndirol) y dref gan gysylltu'r Porth Gorllewinol a Phorth Gwasael. Roedd y rhain yn waliau cerrig. Mae dogfennau hanesyddol yn cyfeirio at dreth ym 1317 i gynnal a chadw'r waliau, ond mae gwaith archaeoleg wedi dangos y gallai'r amddiffynfeydd cerrig fod yn rhai mwy cyfoes pan ailadeiladwyd y castell ar ddiwedd y 13eg ganrif. Ar gornel Whitewalls a Sgw&acirc;r y Santes Fair, gwelwyd bod y wal yn 1.9 metr o drwch, gydag arwyneb o flociau tywodfaen. O flaen y wal roedd ffos tua 6 metr o led a 2 metr o ddyfnder. Gellir dilyn olion yr amddiffynfeydd o amgylch y dref trwy gerdded ar hyd stryd a elwir yn Whitewalls o hyd.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Here, in what is probably the oldest part of Swansea, was the town&rsquo;s main market place. The site was close to the castle and the power of the Anglo-Norman lords. Food, clothes and other goods would have been traded here. One of the witnesses to the hanging of William Cragh has the name Henry Skinner, which suggests that he may have been involved in the local leather trade. It&rsquo;s possible that other places were also used for trading and occasional markets. The Welshman John ap Hywel tells us that he watched the hanging of William Cragh from a &lsquo;platea&rsquo; (an open space or square) by St Mary&rsquo;s Church. This may have been the open area just outside the Wassail Gate, near St Mary&rsquo;s, which has many features typical of market places in medieval towns. This may have been an alternative market place used by the local Welsh community.</p>

									<p><p>This coin may well have changed hands in Swansea&rsquo;s marketplace, located at the upper end of Wind Street. Goods of all kinds were sold here, and the trade in hides and leather goods was particularly important in medieval Swansea. A late 12th-century charter granted to the burgesses by William de Beaumont included a clause banning foreign merchants from selling cloth in Swansea or buying skins from anyone other than citizens of the town. This was a way of protecting and supporting the local economy.</p></p>
