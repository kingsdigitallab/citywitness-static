								<p>Swansea had town walls by the middle of the 14th century, built of stone, at least for a part of their length, with gates for the streets in and out. The town walls were not built around the whole of the town but just for the part immediately around the castle area, as if the town walls were really a way of creating an outer set of defences for the New Castle that was also being built at this time (to replace the Old Castle). The town walls cut through High Street, and ran behind house-plots in Goat Street, then along the side of St Mary&rsquo;s Church, to link up with the town ditch that was created to defend the area of Frog Street and Fisher Street to the south. The town gates have all gone, but from archaeological research and by studying the town&rsquo;s street pattern it is possible to work out where the gates were, as well as the circuit of the walls.</p>

								<p>Roedd Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol yn dref gaerog. Mae'r enw Whitewalls yn atgof rhannol o'r llinell o waliau a oedd yn rhedeg ar ochr orllewinol (mewndirol) y dref gan gysylltu'r Porth Gorllewinol a Phorth Gwasael. Roedd y rhain yn waliau cerrig. Mae dogfennau hanesyddol yn cyfeirio at dreth ym 1317 i gynnal a chadw'r waliau, ond mae gwaith archaeoleg wedi dangos y gallai'r amddiffynfeydd cerrig fod yn rhai mwy cyfoes pan ailadeiladwyd y castell ar ddiwedd y 13eg ganrif. Ar gornel Whitewalls a Sgw&acirc;r y Santes Fair, gwelwyd bod y wal yn 1.9 metr o drwch, gydag arwyneb o flociau tywodfaen. O flaen y wal roedd ffos tua 6 metr o led a 2 metr o ddyfnder. Gellir dilyn olion yr amddiffynfeydd o amgylch y dref trwy gerdded ar hyd stryd a elwir yn Whitewalls o hyd.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Wassail Gate was one of the main gates into the walled town of Swansea in the Middle Ages. It was also the start of the road to Gower, where many of the participants in the story of the hanging of William Cragh lived or came from. William Cragh himself was from Llanrhidian, though he tells us that his own lands had been taken away by his lord and he relied on the help of his friends. (Other medieval documents prove that this really did happen &ndash; Cragh had good reason to hate Lord William de Briouze.) As his name suggests, Adam of Loughor probably originally came from Loughor, across the Gower peninsula, near Llanelli.</p>

									<p><p>This characterful fragment of a medieval earthenware jug spout is decorated with a goblin, whose pointed ears stick out at either side of his face. This decoration suggests the humour and playfulness enjoyed by medieval craftspeople and the users of their wares. Just outside Wassail Gate may have been an alternative marketplace for medieval Swansea &ndash; likely the site of occasional festivities &ndash; and the (post-medieval) name &lsquo;Wassail&rsquo; suggests that this Gate may have been associated with merriment and celebration.</p></p>
