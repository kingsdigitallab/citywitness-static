								<p>Swansea had town walls by the middle of the 14th century, built of stone, at least for a part of their length, with gates for the streets in and out. The town walls were not built around the whole of the town but just for the part immediately around the castle area, as if the town walls were really a way of creating an outer set of defences for the New Castle that was also being built at this time (to replace the Old Castle). The town walls cut through High Street, and ran behind house-plots in Goat Street, then along the side of St Mary&rsquo;s Church, to link up with the town ditch that was created to defend the area of Frog Street and Fisher Street to the south. The town gates have all gone, but from archaeological research and by studying the town&rsquo;s street pattern it is possible to work out where the gates were, as well as the circuit of the walls.</p>

								<p>Roedd Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol yn dref gaerog. Mae'r enw Whitewalls yn atgof rhannol o'r llinell o waliau a oedd yn rhedeg ar ochr orllewinol (mewndirol) y dref gan gysylltu'r Porth Gorllewinol a Phorth Gwasael. Roedd y rhain yn waliau cerrig. Mae dogfennau hanesyddol yn cyfeirio at dreth ym 1317 i gynnal a chadw'r waliau, ond mae gwaith archaeoleg wedi dangos y gallai'r amddiffynfeydd cerrig fod yn rhai mwy cyfoes pan ailadeiladwyd y castell ar ddiwedd y 13eg ganrif. Ar gornel Whitewalls a Sgw&acirc;r y Santes Fair, gwelwyd bod y wal yn 1.9 metr o drwch, gydag arwyneb o flociau tywodfaen. O flaen y wal roedd ffos tua 6 metr o led a 2 metr o ddyfnder. Gellir dilyn olion yr amddiffynfeydd o amgylch y dref trwy gerdded ar hyd stryd a elwir yn Whitewalls o hyd.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Swansea&rsquo;s walls and gates, like the East Gate, were a symbol of Anglo-Norman power and authority, and were viewed with mixed feelings by Welsh people. William Cragh was a rebel accused of involvement in the burning of Oystermouth Castle, but we also know that he was active and known in the local town community of Swansea. Medieval Welsh texts give us some glimpses of the conflicting attitudes Welsh people had to Swansea. Swansea is called a &lsquo;town of broken towers&rsquo; where the women are &lsquo;altogether widows&rsquo; as a result of Welsh raids. But the town is also praised as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 15px;">This small stone loom weight reminds us that women and their work were an important part of the medieval town. Women were associated with spinning and weaving throughout the medieval period &ndash; the early English word for &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, &lsquo;wif&rsquo; actually derives from her role as a weaver. Spinning was work which could be undertaken in a domestic setting while a woman ran the home.</span></span></p></p>
