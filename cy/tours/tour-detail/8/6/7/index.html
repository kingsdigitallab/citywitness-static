								<p>By the mid-14th century, medieval Swansea had reached its maximum size and remained like this until the 1800s. This does not mean that the urban landscape stopped changing, however. New buildings were constructed after 1300, such as the town walls and gates, New Castle, and St David&rsquo;s Hospital. These were all significant building projects, showing that there was money in Swansea at this time to fund these works, as well as a desire by the lord and the townspeople to use them to show off the status of the town to traders and visitors. St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important medieval landmarks. Now a public house, it is a good place to end the tour of the development of Swansea and reflect on how much the town has changed through the centuries.</p>

								<p>Ysbyty Dewi Sant yw un o adeiladau canoloesol pwysicaf Abertawe sy'n sefyll o hyd. Mae tafarn bresennol y Cross Keys yn cynnwys rhannau o'r adeilad o'r 14eg ganrif, sef ysbyty Dewi Fendigaid o Swegnar a sefydlwyd ym 1332. Roedd ysbytai'r Oesoedd Canol yn sefydliadau crefyddol, ac roedd 6 caplan yn gweithio'n Ysbyty Dewi Sant i ddarparu cartref a gofal ar gyfer clerigwyr a lleygwyr hen a methedig. Roedd yr ysbyty mewn lleoliad amlwg a phwysig yn y dref ganoloesol ac mae'r adeiladau sydd wedi goroesi'n dangos bod ganddo ardaloedd preswyl a neuadd gymunedol. Roedd ganddo ardd i dyfu bwyd hefyd. O weddillion y sbwriel a waredwyd yno, gwelodd archaeolegwyr fod gan y preswylwyr fywydau cyfforddus iawn. Roeddent yn mwynhau gwinoedd a nwyddau a fewnforiwyd o Ffrainc, sy'n adlewyrchu cyfoeth a statws yr ysbyty.</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Adam of Loughor was a 13-year-old boy in 1290, when the Welsh rebel William Cragh was hanged in Swansea. Interviewed by representatives of the pope years later, Adam remembers that he sat on Swansea&rsquo;s town walls to get a good view of the hanging. Adam&rsquo;s story reminds us that executions served as popular spectacle in the Middle Ages &ndash; a tense and complex mix of entertainment and reminder of the lord&rsquo;s power and vengeance. Although Adam sought out the walls as a good vantage-point to watch the hanging, he wasn&rsquo;t so happy about seeing Cragh&rsquo;s dead body close up. He tells us that, later, he was too scared to look at Cragh&rsquo;s bloodied corpse when it lay in the house of Thomas Mathews.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea was often under siege. This cannon ball reminds us of the many attacks which the town walls had to withstand, and their important role in protecting the town&rsquo;s inhabitants. Tradition holds that this particular cannon ball was used later, in Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s attack on Swansea Castle in the Civil War (1648).&nbsp;</p></p>
