								<p>By the mid-14th century, medieval Swansea had reached its maximum size and remained like this until the 1800s. This does not mean that the urban landscape stopped changing, however. New buildings were constructed after 1300, such as the town walls and gates, New Castle, and St David&rsquo;s Hospital. These were all significant building projects, showing that there was money in Swansea at this time to fund these works, as well as a desire by the lord and the townspeople to use them to show off the status of the town to traders and visitors. St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important medieval landmarks. Now a public house, it is a good place to end the tour of the development of Swansea and reflect on how much the town has changed through the centuries.</p>

								<p>Ysbyty Dewi Sant yw un o adeiladau canoloesol pwysicaf Abertawe sy'n sefyll o hyd. Mae tafarn bresennol y Cross Keys yn cynnwys rhannau o'r adeilad o'r 14eg ganrif, sef ysbyty Dewi Fendigaid o Swegnar a sefydlwyd ym 1332. Roedd ysbytai'r Oesoedd Canol yn sefydliadau crefyddol, ac roedd 6 caplan yn gweithio'n Ysbyty Dewi Sant i ddarparu cartref a gofal ar gyfer clerigwyr a lleygwyr hen a methedig. Roedd yr ysbyty mewn lleoliad amlwg a phwysig yn y dref ganoloesol ac mae'r adeiladau sydd wedi goroesi'n dangos bod ganddo ardaloedd preswyl a neuadd gymunedol. Roedd ganddo ardd i dyfu bwyd hefyd. O weddillion y sbwriel a waredwyd yno, gwelodd archaeolegwyr fod gan y preswylwyr fywydau cyfforddus iawn. Roeddent yn mwynhau gwinoedd a nwyddau a fewnforiwyd o Ffrainc, sy'n adlewyrchu cyfoeth a statws yr ysbyty.</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Here, in what is probably the oldest part of Swansea, was the town&rsquo;s main market place. The site was close to the castle and the power of the Anglo-Norman lords. Food, clothes and other goods would have been traded here. One of the witnesses to the hanging of William Cragh has the name Henry Skinner, which suggests that he may have been involved in the local leather trade. It&rsquo;s possible that other places were also used for trading and occasional markets. The Welshman John ap Hywel tells us that he watched the hanging of William Cragh from a &lsquo;platea&rsquo; (an open space or square) by St Mary&rsquo;s Church. This may have been the open area just outside the Wassail Gate, near St Mary&rsquo;s, which has many features typical of market places in medieval towns. This may have been an alternative market place used by the local Welsh community.</p>

									<p><p>This coin may well have changed hands in Swansea&rsquo;s marketplace, located at the upper end of Wind Street. Goods of all kinds were sold here, and the trade in hides and leather goods was particularly important in medieval Swansea. A late 12th-century charter granted to the burgesses by William de Beaumont included a clause banning foreign merchants from selling cloth in Swansea or buying skins from anyone other than citizens of the town. This was a way of protecting and supporting the local economy.</p></p>
