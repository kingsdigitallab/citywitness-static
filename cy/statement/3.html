And when those who went returned to <a class="person" data-ref="9">the father</a>&nbsp;and <a class="person" data-ref="2">the witness himself</a>&nbsp;and they said to <a class="person" data-ref="2">the witness himself</a>&nbsp;and the others that the middle beam between the wood upon which <a class="person" data-ref="4">the aforesaid two</a>&nbsp;were hanged <a class="event" data-ref="156">was broken</a>, and that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the aforesaid two</a>&nbsp;were dead.</p>
<br />
<p data-id="p3">&para; Further, thirdly he said, that because <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh</a>&nbsp;was a very famous, and public, malefactor, <a class="person" data-ref="9">the father</a>&nbsp;of <a class="person" data-ref="2">the aforesaid witness</a>&nbsp;(who was not present at the time of the aforesaid capture, but was in his said lands at the time of the hanging) ordered that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh</a>&nbsp;be hanged again, and that <a class="person" data-ref="8">the other</a>&nbsp;who was hanged with him be buried; and so the command was carried out, just as he ordered. And <a class="person" data-ref="2">he</a>&nbsp;said that <a class="person" data-ref="4">said William Cragh</a>&nbsp;was again rehanged and he hung suspended on <a class="location" data-ref="2">the said gallows</a>&nbsp;from the said ninth hour until Vespers,<span class="note" data-type="commentary">Vespers was the sunset service in the medieval Church.

Then the friends of <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said hanged William Cragh</a>&nbsp;asked for his body from <a class="person" data-ref="9">the father</a>&nbsp;of <a class="person" data-ref="2">the said witness</a>&nbsp;in order to be able to bury it themselves the next day.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">It was normal for executed criminals to rely on friends and family rather than the Church to ensure they had a proper burial <a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="34">(Handley, 2011: 51;</a><a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="3">Daniell, 1997: 247;</a>and <a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="20">McCall, 1979: 75).</a></span>&nbsp; And the concession was made, because the people of the said witness, and <a class="person" data-ref="2">the witness himself</a>&nbsp;reported, (and it was commonly said) that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh</a>&nbsp;was dead when he was hanged the second time. And everything said previously concerning the death by the said hanging, <a class="person" data-ref="2">the said witness</a>&nbsp;reported from what he believed and from the reports of others, because he had not seen <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said dead William</a>&nbsp;himself at that time; nevertheless he said that he saw, just as he said, from <a class="location" data-ref="3">the said castle</a>&nbsp;when <a class="person" data-ref="4">William Cragh</a>&nbsp;himself had been hanged the first time on <a class="location" data-ref="2">the said gallows</a>&nbsp;in the morning, and also a while afterwards he saw him hanged again, just as he said. &nbsp;And he heard it said by others that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh</a>&nbsp;was hanging on <a class="location" data-ref="2">the said gallows</a>&nbsp;until about the said setting of the sun.</p>
<br />
<p data-id="p4">&para; Fourthly, he said, that after the aforesaid setting of the sun the same day that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh</a>&nbsp;was hanged, the friends of <a class="person" data-ref="4">William Cragh</a>&nbsp;himself (on account of the favour that <a class="person" data-ref="9">the father</a>&nbsp;of <a class="person" data-ref="2">the witness himself</a>&nbsp;made), were able to bury <a class="person" data-ref="4">the same William.</a>&nbsp;Yet having been questioned, he did not know whether they carried <a class="person" data-ref="4">William</a>&nbsp;themselves to <a class="location" data-ref="10">the town</a>&nbsp;of <a class="location" data-ref="3">the said castle of Swansea</a>&nbsp;from<a class="location" data-ref="4"> the house of a certain burgess</a>&nbsp;(<a class="person" data-ref="12">the said townsman</a> whose name he said he said he could not recall when questioned), or if was in fact on a wooden wheel or even by another means. And then <a class="person" data-ref="2">the witness himself</a>&nbsp;with other members of <a class="person" data-ref="9">his father</a>&rsquo;s household and his [own] men descended from <a class="location" data-ref="3">the said castle</a>, went down to the <a class="location" data-ref="10">said town</a>&nbsp;adjoining <a class="location" data-ref="3">the castle</a>&nbsp;itself, and he saw <a class="person" data-ref="4">the aforesaid William</a>&nbsp;who was hanged, and he discovered him <a class="location" data-ref="4">in the house of the said burgess</a>. Inside <a class="location" data-ref="4">the house</a>&nbsp;[he was] resting head-downwards on the ground in front of the first and larger <span class="pb" data-n="f11r"></span>&nbsp;doorway of <a class="location" data-ref="4">the said house</a>, remaining still as only a dead man can, and <a class="person" data-ref="2">the witness</a>&nbsp;himself and everyone else who saw <a class="person" data-ref="4">William</a>&nbsp;himself thought that <a class="person" data-ref="4">William Cragh</a>&nbsp;himself was dead, just as he said previously in his testimony.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">For a discussion of the contemporary views on the signs of death, see <a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="44">Vauchez, (1997: 491).</a></span>&nbsp; And the at that time when <a class="person" data-ref="2">the said witness</a>&nbsp;saw the <a class="person" data-ref="4">aforesaid William Cragh</a>, he had a totally black face, and with bloodied or blood encrusted parts, and the eyes of <a class="person" data-ref="4">William</a>&nbsp;himself had popped out of their place, hanging down outside the eyelids of the said eyes, and the hollows of the eyes themselves were filled with blood. Moreover, the mouth of <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh</a>&nbsp;and [his] neck and throat and all other parts situated around about, and even [his] nostrils were full of blood.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">It is a typical sign of death by hanging for the corpse to have a protruding tongue, with blood exuding from the mouth&nbsp;<a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="46">(Sharma, 2008: 56).</a>The face also swells, with open and protruding eyes, while the tongue is often thrust out and damaged by &lsquo;the convulsive action of the jaws&rsquo;.

Foremost he said he believed that (according to the way of nature) he was not able to breathe in and breathe out air through the mouth, and through his throat, and also through the neck, or the neck veins, because the tongue of <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>&nbsp;was hanging outside of his mouth further than if it was the length of the middle finger of a man&rsquo;s hand; and the said tongue was black and inflamed with his own blood, and as swollen as if an ordinary man was holding two fists together at the same time; that therefore if he had been alive <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>&nbsp;would not have been able to withdraw his said tongue naturally for it was so swollen and inflamed, nor would he have been able to breathe in or even breathe out air through his mouth. This had been seen by the witness at that time, and it seemed the same to him up until this point, just as he said.</p>

<p data-id="p5">&para; Fifthly he said that seeing <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh</a>, who was hanged, in the aforesaid position in <a class="location" data-ref="4">the house</a>&nbsp;of <a class="person" data-ref="12">the aforesaid burgess</a>, <a class="person" data-ref="2">the said witness</a>&nbsp;returned to <a class="location" data-ref="3">the aforesaid castle.</a>&nbsp;And then (when he had reported back the aforesaid [events] to her), the&nbsp;<a class="person" data-ref="1">aforesaid Lady Mary</a>&nbsp;his stepmother said, with devotion as it seemed to <a class="person" data-ref="2">the same witness</a>, (the witness himself hearing, and being present): &lsquo;<a class="person" data-ref="4">That man</a> was hanged twice and had a great punishment.

<p data-id="p13">&para; Further to the sixth question; he replied that the faith, and devotion of <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh</a>&nbsp;was increased on account of the said miracle because he ceased to perpetrate the said crimes.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">Reformation of character following a miracle was deemed to be an important part of the miracle process, (Koopmans, 2011), and indeed the main reason for the Virgin Mary interceding on behalf of sinners&nbsp;<a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="2">(Warner, 1976: 324-5).</a>&nbsp;Criminals were said to have been reformed thanks to the intercession of St Thomas Becket many of which were performed at his tomb in Canterbury&nbsp;<a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="51">(Sumption, 1975: 128).</a>&nbsp;For further discussion and examples of saintly intercession, see <a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="44">Vauchez (1997: 133-4)</a>&nbsp; and <a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="37">Clements-Jewery (2005).</a></span>&nbsp;And also, others from those parts had greater faith and devotion in God and in <a class="person" data-ref="36">the said St Thomas</a>&nbsp;due to this [miracle], and frequent pilgrimages were made to the tomb of <a class="person" data-ref="36">the said St Thomas</a>.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">Cults growing up around saints did tend to be local in nature.

<br />
<p data-id="p14">&para; Further to the seventh [question]; he replied that it seemed to <a class="person" data-ref="2">the same witness</a>&nbsp;that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh </a>was about 40 years old. However, he did not know to what parents he had been born, nor where he lived; but he had been born in the said lands of <a class="location" data-ref="9">Gower</a>&nbsp;as he testified above.</p>
<br />
<p data-id="p15">&para; Further to the eighth question; he replied that he had seen <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>&nbsp;a hundred times and more before the aforesaid hanging because he was born in the said lands of <a class="person" data-ref="2">him</a>&nbsp;and <a class="person" data-ref="9">his father</a>. And he said after the said hanging, he often saw <a class="person" data-ref="4">him</a>&nbsp;[Cragh] healthy because he lived for ten years and more after the said hanging, and died a natural death two years ago, just as he testified above in the eighth statement.</p>
<br />
<p data-id="p16">&para; Further the ninth and tenth question were answered by <a class="person" data-ref="2">the witness</a>&nbsp;himself above in the first and second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh articles of what he said, and also to the eleventh question of the year and the place in which the aforesaid had happened. They asked about the day; he said he did not remember; concerning the month, he said that it was between the feast of St Michael and the feast of All Saints,<span class="note" data-type="commentary">Between the 29th Spetember and 1st November.</span>&nbsp;but concerning those who were present at the said hanging, he said when they asked him he could not remember.</p>
<br />
<p data-id="p17">&para; Further to the twelfth question, he answered that it was public opinion and the voice of the community in those parts and is to this [day], and all the people commonly discussed this they believed and asserted that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William Cragh</a>&nbsp;was resuscitated because of the miraculous-ness and the intention of <a class="person" data-ref="36">the said St Thomas de Cantilupe</a>.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">The most common request for a saint&rsquo;s intercession was in the hope of a cure<a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="58">(Porterfield, 2005: 70;&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="44" style="display: inline !important;">Vauchez, 1997</a>: 466-77).<br />&nbsp;For the full history of Thomas&rsquo; cures into the seventeenth century (when his relics were paraded around the streets of Hereford to ward off the plague), see <a href="3.html#" class="reference" data-id="43">Crook (2011: 305-6).</a></span>&nbsp; They asked about who thought [this]; he said he had had heard this from public report from all who discussed the aforesaid [events], and had not heard anyone say the opposite. They asked what he was calling and what he believed to be public report, and common opinion in this his testimony? He replied that when something is so true that people commonly assert publically that it had come to pass and no one said the opposite nor did it appear the opposite; and it happened [to be so] in the case in which he himself was testifying, he said.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">A fundamental requirement for the initiation of any inquisitorial or enquiry process called for by the papacy was &lsquo;publica fama&rsquo;.

<p data-id="p18">&para; Further the thirteenth question is answered by his above responses.</p>
<br />
<p data-id="p19">&para; Further they asked whether his testimony have or will have caused by prayer, command, fear, hate, love, reward, profit gained or promised; and whether he had been taught or instructed in the testimony and whether he had harmonised this testimony with other witnesses. He replied no.</p>
<br />
<p data-id="p20">&para; Further they asked if he was related to <a class="person" data-ref="36">the said master Thomas</a>? He replied that he believed that yes, about three or even four times removed,<span class="note" data-type="commentary">For the precise relationship between the Briouze family and Thomas de Cantilupe, see &lsquo;Introduction&rsquo;.</span>&nbsp; but he was not quite certain about that, and he said, he had not seen&nbsp;<a class="person" data-ref="36">the Lord</a><span class="pb" data-n="f13r"></span><a class="person" data-ref="36">Thomas</a>&nbsp;himself, except once or twice, that he recalled, when&nbsp;<a class="person" data-ref="2">the witness</a>&nbsp;himself was a boy.

<br />
<p data-id="p21">&para; Further they asked about his age. He replied that he was about 46 years old.</p>
<br />
<p data-id="p22">&para; Further they asked, if he had seen any other miracle that he believed occurred through the merits of the <a class="person" data-ref="36">said Lord Thomas de Cantilupe</a>? He replied no.
