<br />
<p data-id="p5">&para;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>Also when <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>&nbsp;was hanged, and those who were hanging him clung to one part of the rope with which he was hanged in order that they might tie it to one arm of the aforesaid transverse beam. <a class="event" data-ref="107">It broke</a>&nbsp;and <a class="person" data-ref="4">William</a>&nbsp;himself (who was hanging from the said transverse beam) fell to the ground, but he [<a class="person" data-ref="5">Thomas</a>] did not know if at that time the ladder was moved from under the feet of <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>. And when he had fallen as if unconscious, after as long as a man might have walked more than 100 steps, in his estimation, <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>&nbsp;was <a class="event" data-ref="108">hanged again</a>&nbsp;on one of the arms of <a class="location" data-ref="2">the said gallows</a>.

And his eyes popped out of their cavities (in which they were previously resting) and hanging down outside of the aforesaid cavities and [his] teeth were clenched to such a degree that <a class="person" data-ref="5">the witness</a>&nbsp;himself saw that some of his family (concerning whose names he could not quite remember) were not able to open the mouth of <a class="person" data-ref="4">the aforesaid William</a>. Yet if his tongue was outside of [his] teeth, he said he could not remember.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">It is a typical sign of death by hanging for the corpse to have a protruding tongue, with blood exuding from the mouth&nbsp;<a href="6.html#" class="reference" data-id="46">(Sharma, 2008: 56).</a>&nbsp;The face also swells, with open and protruding eyes, while the tongue is often thrust out and damaged by &lsquo;the convulsive action of the jaws&rsquo;. The longer it takes to die, the more swollen the face neck, lips eyes and tongue become, because the heart and lungs only slowly shut down, meaning that blood continues to be pumped to the head, but cannot return to the heart due to the effect of the rope on the jugular vein, resulting in a build-up of blood in the face and features (Forbes et al., 1833: 175). </span>&nbsp; Yet <a class="person" data-ref="5">he himself</a>&nbsp;did not touch <a class="person" data-ref="4">him</a>; nor did he know if he was hot or cold, or if he had been fed or not.

The idea was that a thread was used to measure the body, and that in the event of a miraculous cure the thread would be made into a votive candle for the saint responsible for the miracle. It was particularly common as a long-range device intended to attract the attention of the saint.
