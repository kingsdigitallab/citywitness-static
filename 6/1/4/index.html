								<p>The ruins of Swansea Castle are the most striking reminder of the city&rsquo;s medieval heritage. This is actually the &lsquo;New&rsquo; Castle, built in the late 13th century to replace the &lsquo;Old&rsquo; Castle (founded around 1106) nearby. The castle displayed the power and status of the Anglo-Norman de Briouze family, who ruled Swansea and the Marcher Lordship of Gower. As well as a large hall on the first floor, the castle boasted an inside latrine (toilet), and also contained a dungeon where criminals and opponents of Anglo-Norman rule were held. A surviving document tells us that the dungeon was supplied with new locks and keys in 1535. In the 18th century, a debtors&rsquo; prison was housed in the large square tower of the castle.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">New Castle was designed to replace the Old Castle, and work on it started around 1284-90 under the lordship of William de Briouze II. The distinctive arcading seen high up on the standing walls was added by John, Lord of Mowbray (1331-54). Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle reflects a period of relative peace with few raids or wars. Being designed to provide comfortable living and working space, the New Castle had well-appointed private rooms with an inside toilet (latrine) that emptied into the moat. There was also a grand entertainment and business area &ndash; a hall &ndash; located on the first floor with a series of basements below. By this time there is also evidence that housing for wealthier residents of Swansea stood in the outer ward of the castle. This area was cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to expose the ruins of the castle and to create Castle Square.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>After he was hanged, the body of William Cragh was carried to the house of Thomas Mathews, a burgess (townsman) of Swansea. His body lay here, bloody and disfigured, with his eyes hanging from their sockets and the tongue swollen out of his mouth. Adam of Loughor, aged around 13 at the time, tells us he was too scared to look at the body. And yet, to everyone&rsquo;s amazement, William Cragh began to come back to life. Many witnesses came to see this and Lady Mary de Briouze &ndash; wife of Lord William who had ordered the execution &ndash; sent a maidservant with nourishing almond milk to help Cragh recover. Was it a miracle?</p>

The button could have slipped from the clothing of any reasonably well-to-do citizen of medieval Swansea: it&rsquo;s something quite ordinary and quite small, but which suggests an intimate and direct connection with an unknown man or woman in the medieval past of Swansea and the Gower.</p></p>
