								<p>The ruins of Swansea Castle are the most striking reminder of the city&rsquo;s medieval heritage. This is actually the &lsquo;New&rsquo; Castle, built in the late 13th century to replace the &lsquo;Old&rsquo; Castle (founded around 1106) nearby. The castle displayed the power and status of the Anglo-Norman de Briouze family, who ruled Swansea and the Marcher Lordship of Gower. As well as a large hall on the first floor, the castle boasted an inside latrine (toilet), and also contained a dungeon where criminals and opponents of Anglo-Norman rule were held. A surviving document tells us that the dungeon was supplied with new locks and keys in 1535. In the 18th century, a debtors&rsquo; prison was housed in the large square tower of the castle.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">New Castle was designed to replace the Old Castle, and work on it started around 1284-90 under the lordship of William de Briouze II. The distinctive arcading seen high up on the standing walls was added by John, Lord of Mowbray (1331-54). Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle reflects a period of relative peace with few raids or wars. Being designed to provide comfortable living and working space, the New Castle had well-appointed private rooms with an inside toilet (latrine) that emptied into the moat. There was also a grand entertainment and business area &ndash; a hall &ndash; located on the first floor with a series of basements below. By this time there is also evidence that housing for wealthier residents of Swansea stood in the outer ward of the castle. This area was cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to expose the ruins of the castle and to create Castle Square.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>At the time of the hanging of William Cragh in 1290, the de Briouze family had moved to the New Castle in Swansea (although they preferred to stay at Oystermouth Castle, in modern-day Mumbles). The castles were a symbol of Anglo-Norman power and a target for attacks by Welsh fighters such as William Cragh. The entry for 1113 in the Welsh Chronicle, Brut y Tywysogion, tells how Welsh warriors attacked Swansea&rsquo;s Old Castle &lsquo;and burnt the environs but could not destroy it, only ravaging the land of Gower&rsquo;. William Cragh was hanged for his part in continuing Welsh rebellions against Anglo-Norman rule.</p>

This image is familiar to us from medieval romances and stories, and represents an idealised version of medieval chivalry. Swansea&rsquo;s Old Castle was home to the noble de Briouze family until the later 1280s, but the experience of the de Briouze men here on the Anglo-Norman frontier was probably more about real violence and managing local tensions than elaborate tournaments &nbsp;or pageantry.</span></p></p>
