								<p>The ruins of Swansea Castle are the most striking reminder of the city&rsquo;s medieval heritage. This is actually the &lsquo;New&rsquo; Castle, built in the late 13th century to replace the &lsquo;Old&rsquo; Castle (founded around 1106) nearby. The castle displayed the power and status of the Anglo-Norman de Briouze family, who ruled Swansea and the Marcher Lordship of Gower. As well as a large hall on the first floor, the castle boasted an inside latrine (toilet), and also contained a dungeon where criminals and opponents of Anglo-Norman rule were held. A surviving document tells us that the dungeon was supplied with new locks and keys in 1535. In the 18th century, a debtors&rsquo; prison was housed in the large square tower of the castle.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">New Castle was designed to replace the Old Castle, and work on it started around 1284-90 under the lordship of William de Briouze II. The distinctive arcading seen high up on the standing walls was added by John, Lord of Mowbray (1331-54). Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle reflects a period of relative peace with few raids or wars. Being designed to provide comfortable living and working space, the New Castle had well-appointed private rooms with an inside toilet (latrine) that emptied into the moat. There was also a grand entertainment and business area &ndash; a hall &ndash; located on the first floor with a series of basements below. By this time there is also evidence that housing for wealthier residents of Swansea stood in the outer ward of the castle. This area was cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to expose the ruins of the castle and to create Castle Square.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On an autumn day in the year 1290, William Cragh was hanged on Gibbet Hill by William de Briouze, the Anglo-Norman lord of Gower. Cragh was hanged as a rebel and criminal, together with another Welshman, Trahaearn ap Hywel. In an act of particular cruelty, Lord William forced Cragh&rsquo;s own friends and family to perform the hanging. Cragh was lifted onto the gibbet first, and then Trahaearn was pulled up by a rope slung over the crossbeam. But one medieval witness at the execution tells us that Trahaearn was &lsquo;big and heavy&rsquo;, and this caused the gibbet to break. Cragh and Trahaearn were hanged for a second time and seemed to be dead. But was that really the case?</p>
