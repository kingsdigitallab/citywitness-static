								<p>Swansea&rsquo;s main market place was held at the top of Wind Street. Food, clothes and household items would be traded here. Archaeological finds show that fine imported wine was drunk in Swansea in the Middle Ages. Trade in leather and hides was also an important part of the local economy. At the bottom of Wind Street, the South Gate led out to marshland and a ferry across the Tawe. At the top of the street, the Castle loomed large.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">For medieval Swansea, like all medieval towns, the market place was its commercial core, where traders gathered. The market place in Wind Street is probably the earliest part of medieval Swansea, perhaps laid out at the same time the castle was first built, in around 1100. Its location, beneath the castle, meant it could be watched closely by the Lords of the Gower. By 1300 it was perhaps home to some of its wealthiest residents. Swansea had a weekly market and two yearly fairs, and on other days the market place was used for meetings and street entertainment during religious festivals. Food was one of the main goods sold, as well as clothes and household items. These were sold from stalls and booths which could be set up and taken down on market days.</p>

							<p>The North Gate was in the town walls on Swansea&rsquo;s High Street, and many of the witnesses to the William Cragh story passed through the Gate as they moved between key locations. Lord William&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, goes through the Gate repeatedly as he visits Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to see Cragh&rsquo;s body and reports back to his master in the Castle. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maidservants, Jovanta or Sunehild, also pass through the North Gate on their way to take almond milk to the recovering William Cragh.</p>

									<p><p>This impressive sword speaks of the ever-present reality of violence in medieval Swansea. The North Gate was a point where entry to the walled town was controlled, serving to protect the city against attack. John of Baggeham, steward of William de Briouze in 1290, tells us how he and a band of other men carry arms with them to ensure that the power of the Anglo-Norman lord is enforced and the town is kept under control.</p></p>
