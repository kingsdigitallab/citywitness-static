								<p>Now incorporated into the Cross Keys Pub, St David&rsquo;s Hospital is another of Swansea&rsquo;s visible medieval buildings. Founded in 1332, it housed elderly and infirm clergy and laymen, and included residential areas, a communal hall and a garden. Like the New Castle, St David&rsquo;s Hospital is a rare survival of the city&rsquo;s medieval past. Many of Swansea&rsquo;s historic buildings, and the lay-out of its medieval streets, were destroyed in the Three Nights Blitz of 1941 &ndash; as well as in the subsequent clearing and re-development of the town centre.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important standing medieval buildings. The present Cross Keys pub incorporates parts of a 14th century building that was the hospital of the Blessed David of Swegnar, founded in 1332. Medieval hospitals were religious institutions, and St David&rsquo;s was staffed by six chaplains to provide a home and care for sick and infirm clergy and laymen. The hospital stood in a prominent and important location in the medieval town and the surviving buildings show it was well appointed with residential areas and a communal hall. It had a garden for growing food. From the remains of rubbish disposed there, archaeologists have shown that residents lived very comfortably, enjoying fine imported wines and goods from France, reflecting the wealth and status of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The parish church for medieval Swansea, St Mary&rsquo;s benefited from the patronage of the de Briouze family. We know that Lady Mary de Briouze &ndash; wife of the Lord William who ordered the hanging of the Welshman William Cragh &ndash; was a religious and devout woman, and we can imagine her visiting St Mary&rsquo;s for services and prayer. While the medieval structure of St Mary&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t survive today, the story of William Cragh also gives us other clues about what might have been there. For example, while Cragh is in the dungeons of Swansea Castle before his hanging, he reports seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary. But he says that she wasn&rsquo;t holding her son, the Christ child, &lsquo;as material images concerning her represent&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s possible that Cragh was thinking of pictures of Mary which he had seen in Swansea&rsquo;s parish church, itself dedicated to her. Wall paintings and statues of Mary were very common in Wales at this time.</p>

									<p><p>This carved stone head was found at the site of the old Rectory House in Fisher Street, Swansea in the late 19th century and is thought to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally believed to depict Alina de Mowbray, daughter of Lord William de Briouze (junior) who testified in 1307 as a witness to the hanging of William Cragh. Alina&rsquo;s own life was colourful and her fortunes very changeable. Today, she is remembered as the ghostly &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo; of Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles.&nbsp;</p></p>
