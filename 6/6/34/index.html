								<p>Like many medieval towns, Swansea was defended with walls to protect it against attacks. The walls of medieval Swansea ran along the west and north of the town &ndash; the east was already bounded by the River Tawe and to the south lay marshland and the Cadle stream. Here, the medieval walls ran along the line of Whitewalls Street. Archaeological excavations were under the red-brick shop on the corner (currently Primark). Just south of here, the Wassail Gate opened out onto the road to Gower. To the north, the town&rsquo;s West Gate led out to the Washing Pool where the townsfolk may have come to do their laundry.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Medieval Swansea was a walled town. The line of walls is in part recalled by the name Whitewalls and ran on the western (inland) side of the town connecting West Gate and Wassail Gate. The walls here were made of stone. Historical documents refer to a tax in 1317 for the upkeep of the walls while archaeology has shown that the stone defences may be contemporary with the rebuilding of the castle in the late 13th&nbsp;century. At the corner of Whitewalls and St Mary&rsquo;s Square, the wall was shown to be 1.9 metres thick, faced with sandstone blocks. In front of the wall was a ditch about 6 metres wide and 2 metres deep. The line of the defences around the town can be followed by walking along the street still called Whitewalls.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The Hospital of St David was founded after the hanging of William Cragh, in 1332 (Cragh was hanged in 1290). But the values of the Hospital reflect medieval traditions of charity, alms-giving and care for the sick and poor which we also glimpse in the story of William Cragh. Lady Mary de Briouze, wife of the Lord William who orders Cragh&rsquo;s execution, performs acts of charity often associated with medieval noblewomen by sending almond milk and broth to help nourish Cragh after the hanging. There&rsquo;s a fascinating tension here between Mary&rsquo;s duty to support her husband&rsquo;s rule as Marcher lord, and her Christian obligation to support the vulnerable members of Swansea&rsquo;s community.</p>
