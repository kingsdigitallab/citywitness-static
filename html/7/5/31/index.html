								<p>The North Gate was one of the points where entry into medieval Swansea was controlled. Swords, daggers and cannon balls found in Swansea remind us of its violent past. Many people met a bloody end here in the Middle Ages. Medieval Welsh poetry calls Swansea a &lsquo;town of broken towers&rsquo; where the women are &lsquo;altogether widows&rsquo; as a result of Welsh raids.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">North Gate stood on High Street guarding the main entrance into the town from the north. The gate no longer stands but the line of the town walls here is preserved in the alignment of Morris Lane and King Street. Archaeologists working here discovered parts of the medieval town-ditch which showed it to be 10m wide and 3 metres deep. North Gate controlled access into and out of the town, and divided those inside the walled town from those outside, in the suburbs beyond the wall, known in historical documents as Above Town.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>In the late 13th century, the Strand ran along the River Tawe, where ships unloaded their goods. Swansea&rsquo;s status as a port and trading city is reflected in Welsh poetry, which celebrates the town as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;. But the strand, and the land around it which sloped down to the river, was overlooked by Swansea Castle and the Anglo-Norman lords who controlled the town. The story of the hanging of William Cragh in 1290 shows us how the ruling de Briouze family were able to look out over the surrounding landscape from the castle, helping them to enforce their power and authority.</p>

									<p><p>In the Middle Ages, the Strand ran along the River Tawe and was a bustling place where ships unloaded their wares and moored for repairs. Not all ships made it safely to harbour: this early medieval pot was brought up from a shipwreck by fishing nets in the 19th century. It reflects medieval Swansea&rsquo;s importance as a trading centre and busy sea-port.</p></p>
