								<p>The role of Mary de Briouze, Lady of Swansea Castle, in the hanging of the Welshman William Cragh, is strange and mysterious. Mary&rsquo;s husband, Lord William de Briouze, ordered the execution of Cragh. But Mary begged for Cragh&rsquo;s life to be spared. When her husband refused, she then prayed to St Thomas de Cantilupe, a popular saint, to intervene. As Cragh began to recover, she sent her maidservants &ndash; and possibly her own daughter &ndash; to nurse him back to health. Why did Lady Mary care so much about a condemned Welsh outlaw? Could there be a story of secret allegiances or even forbidden love hidden here&hellip;?</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">New Castle was designed to replace the Old Castle, and work on it started around 1284-90 under the lordship of William de Briouze II. The distinctive arcading seen high up on the standing walls was added by John, Lord of Mowbray (1331-54). Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle reflects a period of relative peace with few raids or wars. Being designed to provide comfortable living and working space, the New Castle had well-appointed private rooms with an inside toilet (latrine) that emptied into the moat. There was also a grand entertainment and business area &ndash; a hall &ndash; located on the first floor with a series of basements below. By this time there is also evidence that housing for wealthier residents of Swansea stood in the outer ward of the castle. This area was cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to expose the ruins of the castle and to create Castle Square.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>After William Cragh was hanged, his friends carried his apparently lifeless body to the Chapel of St John. This may have been because the Chapel had a long-standing association with the Welsh community, and it was located outside the town walls. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that Cragh&rsquo;s body was transported on a kind of wooden wheel, which in itself would have caused great injury. The different medieval witnesses don&rsquo;t agree on what happened when Cragh&rsquo;s body arrived at the Chapel of St John. It seems likely that the Chapel was closed, and Cragh&rsquo;s body was then carried to the nearby house of Thomas Mathews.</p>

This incense burner or censer is in shaped like an ornate tower, representing the city of God &ndash; the heavenly Jerusalem. It reminds us that the heavenly Jerusalem was seen as a model for the earthly city in the Middle Ages &ndash; an ideal of perfect peace and harmony, ruled by God, with every member of the community in their proper place.</p></p>
