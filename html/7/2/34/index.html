								<p>William Cragh, the Welshman hanged by Lord William de Briouze in 1290, spent the night before his execution here with other condemned men. The castle dungeons were a place of suffering and despair, where criminals and opponents of the Anglo-Norman regime were held. Later, in the 18th century, part of Swansea Castle became a debtors&rsquo; prison. Is this place still haunted by the pleas and moans of the unfortunate individuals who languished here?</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">There are references to the dungeon at the castle in 1322, 1400 and 1535 when it was provided with new locks and keys. Despite this where the dungeon was located in Swansea Castle is not known. A later prison for debtors was established in the square tower set in the defensive wall surrounding the castle. In the medieval period, the view from this tower would have looked over the Strand and the River Tawe to the open fields and hills on the opposite bank. In the 18th century the upper floor of the tower was modified to serve as the debtors&rsquo; prison, re-establishing the centuries-old link between the Castle and the detention of prisoners involved in rebellions such as William Cragh&rsquo;s attack on Swansea and Oystermouth Castles in 1287.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The Hospital of St David was founded after the hanging of William Cragh, in 1332 (Cragh was hanged in 1290). But the values of the Hospital reflect medieval traditions of charity, alms-giving and care for the sick and poor which we also glimpse in the story of William Cragh. Lady Mary de Briouze, wife of the Lord William who orders Cragh&rsquo;s execution, performs acts of charity often associated with medieval noblewomen by sending almond milk and broth to help nourish Cragh after the hanging. There&rsquo;s a fascinating tension here between Mary&rsquo;s duty to support her husband&rsquo;s rule as Marcher lord, and her Christian obligation to support the vulnerable members of Swansea&rsquo;s community.</p>
