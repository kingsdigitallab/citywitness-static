								<p>From here you have a view up to North Hill, known in the Middle Ages as Gibbet Hill, where William Cragh was hanged on an autumn morning in 1290. But the execution went wrong: the crossbeam of the gallows broke and Cragh fell to the ground. He was hauled up again and hanged a second time.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Gibbet Hill was the site of Swansea&rsquo;s place of execution, for hangings. Now called North Hill, until the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century the name Gibbet Hill was used, while Gallows Road, now known as North Hill Road, led to the gibbet from the town. The exact position of the medieval gibbet &ndash; or gallows &ndash; is uncertain, but most likely it stood on the edge of the hill, facing the town, so standing out against the sky line when viewed from Swansea beneath. This position on the edge of the town was typical for medieval places of execution and judgement, and made a hanging all the more a public spectacle as prisoners were led from the prison in the Castle through the streets to Gibbet Hill.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>After William Cragh was hanged, his friends carried his apparently lifeless body to the Chapel of St John. This may have been because the Chapel had a long-standing association with the Welsh community, and it was located outside the town walls. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that Cragh&rsquo;s body was transported on a kind of wooden wheel, which in itself would have caused great injury. The different medieval witnesses don&rsquo;t agree on what happened when Cragh&rsquo;s body arrived at the Chapel of St John. It seems likely that the Chapel was closed, and Cragh&rsquo;s body was then carried to the nearby house of Thomas Mathews.</p>
