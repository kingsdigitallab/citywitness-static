								<p>Finding the Chapel of St John closed, Cragh&rsquo;s friends carried his body to the house of a local townsman, Thomas Mathews. Although we don&rsquo;t know the exact location of Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house, it was close to St John&rsquo;s, and this area of the High Street still shows the pattern of medieval plots fronting the street. While lying in this house, William Cragh gradually came back to life. Was it a miracle?</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Swansea&rsquo;s townsfolk lived in houses fronting onto the town&rsquo;s streets, but what these houses looked like is hard to say. Very few medieval buildings have been excavated in Swansea, but some on Goat Street have. The houses here were timber framed with tiled roofs and decorated ridge tiles. In the William Cragh story, Thomas Matthews&rsquo; house is mentioned, standing close to St John&rsquo;s church. Exactly where his house stood is impossible to say, but interestingly along this part of High Street there are still surviving the patterns of medieval house-plots of the kind that would have been there in Cragh&rsquo;s day. The front of the house-plot in medieval Swansea might be used for shops or workshops, with living accommodation at the rear or on the upper floors. To the rear was a long plot which would have formed a yard, with out-buildings used for storage and perhaps industrial activity, with pits used for toilets and the disposal of rubbish. Here too was space for a vegetable plot and somewhere to keep animals.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On the morning of the execution, William Cragh and Trahaearn ap Hywel, the other condemned man, were led out of the West Gate towards Gibbet Hill. The priest Thomas Marshall tells us that Cragh wore a shirt and breeches; Trahaearn was in a tunic with his hands tied behind his back. Another priest, William Codineston, walked with the condemned men. He tells us that Cragh wanted to make a confession &ndash; but Codineston didn&rsquo;t speak Welsh and couldn&rsquo;t help. William Codineston also tells us that he left the execution posse as it passed through the Gate as he didn&rsquo;t think it was appropriate for him to follow &lsquo;due to his status as a priest&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea could b a dangerous place, where tensions between different groups and individuals could run high. The road to Gower begins from Swansea&rsquo;s West Gate, making it a particularly likely route into Swansea for the Welsh community outside the mainly Anglo-Norman town. This dagger reminds us of the constant dangers of attack, siege and rebellion in medieval Swansea and the marcher lordship of Gower.</p></p>
