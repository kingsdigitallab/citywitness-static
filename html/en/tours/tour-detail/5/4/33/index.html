								<p>Finding the Chapel of St John closed, Cragh&rsquo;s friends carried his body to the house of a local townsman, Thomas Mathews. Although we don&rsquo;t know the exact location of Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house, it was close to St John&rsquo;s, and this area of the High Street still shows the pattern of medieval plots fronting the street. While lying in this house, William Cragh gradually came back to life. Was it a miracle?</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Swansea&rsquo;s townsfolk lived in houses fronting onto the town&rsquo;s streets, but what these houses looked like is hard to say. Very few medieval buildings have been excavated in Swansea, but some on Goat Street have. The houses here were timber framed with tiled roofs and decorated ridge tiles. In the William Cragh story, Thomas Matthews&rsquo; house is mentioned, standing close to St John&rsquo;s church. Exactly where his house stood is impossible to say, but interestingly along this part of High Street there are still surviving the patterns of medieval house-plots of the kind that would have been there in Cragh&rsquo;s day. The front of the house-plot in medieval Swansea might be used for shops or workshops, with living accommodation at the rear or on the upper floors. To the rear was a long plot which would have formed a yard, with out-buildings used for storage and perhaps industrial activity, with pits used for toilets and the disposal of rubbish. Here too was space for a vegetable plot and somewhere to keep animals.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Running north through the town, the High Street was the main route between Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle and the probable location of the house of Thomas Mathews, near the Chapel of St John. It was in the house of Thomas Mathews that William Cragh&rsquo;s body was laid after the hanging &ndash; and where he gradually revived. Lord William de Briouze&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, made the journey along the High Street repeatedly as he hurried between the Castle and Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to observe and report on the situation. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maids also went back and forth along the High Street with broth and almond milk for the recovering Cragh.</p>

									<p><p>These stones would have been used for grinding corn to mill flour, an important commodity for trade and consumption in medieval Swansea. A Swansea charter in the 12th century gives all burgesses the right to have their own oven for baking bread, although they were not allowed to grind corn in their own houses. This meant that they had to use the lord&rsquo;s mill and pay for the privilege!</p></p>
