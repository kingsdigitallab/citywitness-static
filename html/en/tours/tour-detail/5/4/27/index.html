								<p>Finding the Chapel of St John closed, Cragh&rsquo;s friends carried his body to the house of a local townsman, Thomas Mathews. Although we don&rsquo;t know the exact location of Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house, it was close to St John&rsquo;s, and this area of the High Street still shows the pattern of medieval plots fronting the street. While lying in this house, William Cragh gradually came back to life. Was it a miracle?</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Swansea&rsquo;s townsfolk lived in houses fronting onto the town&rsquo;s streets, but what these houses looked like is hard to say. Very few medieval buildings have been excavated in Swansea, but some on Goat Street have. The houses here were timber framed with tiled roofs and decorated ridge tiles. In the William Cragh story, Thomas Matthews&rsquo; house is mentioned, standing close to St John&rsquo;s church. Exactly where his house stood is impossible to say, but interestingly along this part of High Street there are still surviving the patterns of medieval house-plots of the kind that would have been there in Cragh&rsquo;s day. The front of the house-plot in medieval Swansea might be used for shops or workshops, with living accommodation at the rear or on the upper floors. To the rear was a long plot which would have formed a yard, with out-buildings used for storage and perhaps industrial activity, with pits used for toilets and the disposal of rubbish. Here too was space for a vegetable plot and somewhere to keep animals.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>At the time of the hanging of William Cragh in 1290, the de Briouze family had moved to the New Castle in Swansea (although they preferred to stay at Oystermouth Castle, in modern-day Mumbles). The castles were a symbol of Anglo-Norman power and a target for attacks by Welsh fighters such as William Cragh. The entry for 1113 in the Welsh Chronicle, Brut y Tywysogion, tells how Welsh warriors attacked Swansea&rsquo;s Old Castle &lsquo;and burnt the environs but could not destroy it, only ravaging the land of Gower&rsquo;. William Cragh was hanged for his part in continuing Welsh rebellions against Anglo-Norman rule.</p>

This image is familiar to us from medieval romances and stories, and represents an idealised version of medieval chivalry. Swansea&rsquo;s Old Castle was home to the noble de Briouze family until the later 1280s, but the experience of the de Briouze men here on the Anglo-Norman frontier was probably more about real violence and managing local tensions than elaborate tournaments &nbsp;or pageantry.</span></p></p>
