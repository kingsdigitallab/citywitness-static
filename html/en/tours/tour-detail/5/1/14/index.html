								<p>In 1290, the Welshman William Cragh was captured by William de Briouze, the Anglo-Norman Lord of Gower, for his part in a rebellion and attack on Oystermouth Castle, in Mumbles. The night before his execution, Cragh was held here in the dungeons of Swansea Castle, where he received visions of the Virgin Mary and St Thomas de Cantilupe, a popular saint.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">There are references to the dungeon at the castle in 1322, 1400 and 1535 when it was provided with new locks and keys. Despite this where the dungeon was located in Swansea Castle is not known. A later prison for debtors was established in the square tower set in the defensive wall surrounding the castle. In the medieval period, the view from this tower would have looked over the Strand and the River Tawe to the open fields and hills on the opposite bank. In the 18th century the upper floor of the tower was modified to serve as the debtors&rsquo; prison, re-establishing the centuries-old link between the Castle and the detention of prisoners involved in rebellions such as William Cragh&rsquo;s attack on Swansea and Oystermouth Castles in 1287.&nbsp;</p>
