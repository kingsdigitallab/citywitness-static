								<p>In 1290, the Welshman William Cragh was captured by William de Briouze, the Anglo-Norman Lord of Gower, for his part in a rebellion and attack on Oystermouth Castle, in Mumbles. The night before his execution, Cragh was held here in the dungeons of Swansea Castle, where he received visions of the Virgin Mary and St Thomas de Cantilupe, a popular saint.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">There are references to the dungeon at the castle in 1322, 1400 and 1535 when it was provided with new locks and keys. Despite this where the dungeon was located in Swansea Castle is not known. A later prison for debtors was established in the square tower set in the defensive wall surrounding the castle. In the medieval period, the view from this tower would have looked over the Strand and the River Tawe to the open fields and hills on the opposite bank. In the 18th century the upper floor of the tower was modified to serve as the debtors&rsquo; prison, re-establishing the centuries-old link between the Castle and the detention of prisoners involved in rebellions such as William Cragh&rsquo;s attack on Swansea and Oystermouth Castles in 1287.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>When the Welshman William Cragh was hanged in 1290, the New Castle was the Swansea home of the de Briouze family. Lord William de Briouze, the son of the Lord William who ordered the hanging, tells us in his witness testimony that he (and his guests) watched the hanging from the windows of the Castle hall. They were able to see the broken crossbeam of the gibbet and William Cragh hanged for a second time. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that she and her maidservants and other companions were in the Castle praying to St Thomas de Cantilupe for Wililam Cragh&rsquo;s life to be spared. We don&rsquo;t know why Mary was so keen for Cragh to be saved.</p>

									<p><p>This delicate silver brooch, decorated with cross-hatched collar knots, is perhaps the kind of ornament which might have been worn by Mary de Briouze, Lady of Swansea Castle in the late 13th century. A wealthy noblewoman, Lady Mary would have had access to (relatively) fine clothes and jewellery. But her life was controlled and restricted and often confined to the Castle.</p></p>
