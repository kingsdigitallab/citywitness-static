								<p>Standing here in the Middle Ages you would have been at the edge of the River Tawe and in the midst of a bustling harbour. But not every ship made it safely into port. The object you can view for this location is an early medieval pot, brought up from a shipwreck by fishing nets in the 19th century. Many boats and seafarers have been lost in the waters around Swansea. Traces of some of these lost souls may well be under your feet right here, deep beneath the earth, where the river once flowed.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Maritime trade was the key to medieval Swansea&rsquo;s prosperity as a town and a port. The place in the town where ships were moored was the Strand, the name meaning beach or shore. The modern road called Strand indicates the medieval line of the banks of the Tawe where ships could be taken out of the river either for unloading or repairs. Goods brought to Swansea by sea would have entered the town through the streets leading up from the Strand. Several narrow alleys still survive, such as Green Dragon Lane, connecting the Strand to the town&rsquo;s main medieval market place in Wind Street. Historical documents and archaeological evidence show that by the 13th century Swansea had a thriving coastal business to areas such as North Devon and ports such as Bristol. Luxury goods such as wine were imported from France for the wealthier members of Swansea&rsquo;s medieval population. Improvements to the river in the 19th century resulted in the creation of the New Cut in 1843 which moved the river to its present course.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The parish church for medieval Swansea, St Mary&rsquo;s benefited from the patronage of the de Briouze family. We know that Lady Mary de Briouze &ndash; wife of the Lord William who ordered the hanging of the Welshman William Cragh &ndash; was a religious and devout woman, and we can imagine her visiting St Mary&rsquo;s for services and prayer. While the medieval structure of St Mary&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t survive today, the story of William Cragh also gives us other clues about what might have been there. For example, while Cragh is in the dungeons of Swansea Castle before his hanging, he reports seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary. But he says that she wasn&rsquo;t holding her son, the Christ child, &lsquo;as material images concerning her represent&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s possible that Cragh was thinking of pictures of Mary which he had seen in Swansea&rsquo;s parish church, itself dedicated to her. Wall paintings and statues of Mary were very common in Wales at this time.</p>

									<p><p>This carved stone head was found at the site of the old Rectory House in Fisher Street, Swansea in the late 19th century and is thought to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally believed to depict Alina de Mowbray, daughter of Lord William de Briouze (junior) who testified in 1307 as a witness to the hanging of William Cragh. Alina&rsquo;s own life was colourful and her fortunes very changeable. Today, she is remembered as the ghostly &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo; of Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles.&nbsp;</p></p>
