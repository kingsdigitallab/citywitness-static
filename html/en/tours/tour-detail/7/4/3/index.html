								<p>Standing here in the Middle Ages you would have been at the edge of the River Tawe and in the midst of a bustling harbour. But not every ship made it safely into port. The object you can view for this location is an early medieval pot, brought up from a shipwreck by fishing nets in the 19th century. Many boats and seafarers have been lost in the waters around Swansea. Traces of some of these lost souls may well be under your feet right here, deep beneath the earth, where the river once flowed.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Maritime trade was the key to medieval Swansea&rsquo;s prosperity as a town and a port. The place in the town where ships were moored was the Strand, the name meaning beach or shore. The modern road called Strand indicates the medieval line of the banks of the Tawe where ships could be taken out of the river either for unloading or repairs. Goods brought to Swansea by sea would have entered the town through the streets leading up from the Strand. Several narrow alleys still survive, such as Green Dragon Lane, connecting the Strand to the town&rsquo;s main medieval market place in Wind Street. Historical documents and archaeological evidence show that by the 13th century Swansea had a thriving coastal business to areas such as North Devon and ports such as Bristol. Luxury goods such as wine were imported from France for the wealthier members of Swansea&rsquo;s medieval population. Improvements to the river in the 19th century resulted in the creation of the New Cut in 1843 which moved the river to its present course.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>When the Welshman William Cragh was hanged in 1290, the New Castle was the Swansea home of the de Briouze family. Lord William de Briouze, the son of the Lord William who ordered the hanging, tells us in his witness testimony that he (and his guests) watched the hanging from the windows of the Castle hall. They were able to see the broken crossbeam of the gibbet and William Cragh hanged for a second time. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that she and her maidservants and other companions were in the Castle praying to St Thomas de Cantilupe for Wililam Cragh&rsquo;s life to be spared. We don&rsquo;t know why Mary was so keen for Cragh to be saved.</p>

									<p><p>This delicate silver brooch, decorated with cross-hatched collar knots, is perhaps the kind of ornament which might have been worn by Mary de Briouze, Lady of Swansea Castle in the late 13th century. A wealthy noblewoman, Lady Mary would have had access to (relatively) fine clothes and jewellery. But her life was controlled and restricted and often confined to the Castle.</p></p>
