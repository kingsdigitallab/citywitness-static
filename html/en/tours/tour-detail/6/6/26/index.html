								<p>Like many medieval towns, Swansea was defended with walls to protect it against attacks. The walls of medieval Swansea ran along the west and north of the town &ndash; the east was already bounded by the River Tawe and to the south lay marshland and the Cadle stream. Here, the medieval walls ran along the line of Whitewalls Street. Archaeological excavations were under the red-brick shop on the corner (currently Primark). Just south of here, the Wassail Gate opened out onto the road to Gower. To the north, the town&rsquo;s West Gate led out to the Washing Pool where the townsfolk may have come to do their laundry.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Medieval Swansea was a walled town. The line of walls is in part recalled by the name Whitewalls and ran on the western (inland) side of the town connecting West Gate and Wassail Gate. The walls here were made of stone. Historical documents refer to a tax in 1317 for the upkeep of the walls while archaeology has shown that the stone defences may be contemporary with the rebuilding of the castle in the late 13th&nbsp;century. At the corner of Whitewalls and St Mary&rsquo;s Square, the wall was shown to be 1.9 metres thick, faced with sandstone blocks. In front of the wall was a ditch about 6 metres wide and 2 metres deep. The line of the defences around the town can be followed by walking along the street still called Whitewalls.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Here, in what is probably the oldest part of Swansea, was the town&rsquo;s main market place. The site was close to the castle and the power of the Anglo-Norman lords. Food, clothes and other goods would have been traded here. One of the witnesses to the hanging of William Cragh has the name Henry Skinner, which suggests that he may have been involved in the local leather trade. It&rsquo;s possible that other places were also used for trading and occasional markets. The Welshman John ap Hywel tells us that he watched the hanging of William Cragh from a &lsquo;platea&rsquo; (an open space or square) by St Mary&rsquo;s Church. This may have been the open area just outside the Wassail Gate, near St Mary&rsquo;s, which has many features typical of market places in medieval towns. This may have been an alternative market place used by the local Welsh community.</p>

									<p><p>This coin may well have changed hands in Swansea&rsquo;s marketplace, located at the upper end of Wind Street. Goods of all kinds were sold here, and the trade in hides and leather goods was particularly important in medieval Swansea. A late 12th-century charter granted to the burgesses by William de Beaumont included a clause banning foreign merchants from selling cloth in Swansea or buying skins from anyone other than citizens of the town. This was a way of protecting and supporting the local economy.</p></p>
