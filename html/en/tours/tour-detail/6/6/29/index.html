								<p>Like many medieval towns, Swansea was defended with walls to protect it against attacks. The walls of medieval Swansea ran along the west and north of the town &ndash; the east was already bounded by the River Tawe and to the south lay marshland and the Cadle stream. Here, the medieval walls ran along the line of Whitewalls Street. Archaeological excavations were under the red-brick shop on the corner (currently Primark). Just south of here, the Wassail Gate opened out onto the road to Gower. To the north, the town&rsquo;s West Gate led out to the Washing Pool where the townsfolk may have come to do their laundry.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Medieval Swansea was a walled town. The line of walls is in part recalled by the name Whitewalls and ran on the western (inland) side of the town connecting West Gate and Wassail Gate. The walls here were made of stone. Historical documents refer to a tax in 1317 for the upkeep of the walls while archaeology has shown that the stone defences may be contemporary with the rebuilding of the castle in the late 13th&nbsp;century. At the corner of Whitewalls and St Mary&rsquo;s Square, the wall was shown to be 1.9 metres thick, faced with sandstone blocks. In front of the wall was a ditch about 6 metres wide and 2 metres deep. The line of the defences around the town can be followed by walking along the street still called Whitewalls.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Swansea&rsquo;s walls and gates, like the East Gate, were a symbol of Anglo-Norman power and authority, and were viewed with mixed feelings by Welsh people. William Cragh was a rebel accused of involvement in the burning of Oystermouth Castle, but we also know that he was active and known in the local town community of Swansea. Medieval Welsh texts give us some glimpses of the conflicting attitudes Welsh people had to Swansea. Swansea is called a &lsquo;town of broken towers&rsquo; where the women are &lsquo;altogether widows&rsquo; as a result of Welsh raids. But the town is also praised as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 15px;">This small stone loom weight reminds us that women and their work were an important part of the medieval town. Women were associated with spinning and weaving throughout the medieval period &ndash; the early English word for &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, &lsquo;wif&rsquo; actually derives from her role as a weaver. Spinning was work which could be undertaken in a domestic setting while a woman ran the home.</span></span></p></p>
