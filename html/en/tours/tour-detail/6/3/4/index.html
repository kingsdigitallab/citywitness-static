								<p>Swansea&rsquo;s main market place was held at the top of Wind Street. Food, clothes and household items would be traded here. Archaeological finds show that fine imported wine was drunk in Swansea in the Middle Ages. Trade in leather and hides was also an important part of the local economy. At the bottom of Wind Street, the South Gate led out to marshland and a ferry across the Tawe. At the top of the street, the Castle loomed large.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">For medieval Swansea, like all medieval towns, the market place was its commercial core, where traders gathered. The market place in Wind Street is probably the earliest part of medieval Swansea, perhaps laid out at the same time the castle was first built, in around 1100. Its location, beneath the castle, meant it could be watched closely by the Lords of the Gower. By 1300 it was perhaps home to some of its wealthiest residents. Swansea had a weekly market and two yearly fairs, and on other days the market place was used for meetings and street entertainment during religious festivals. Food was one of the main goods sold, as well as clothes and household items. These were sold from stalls and booths which could be set up and taken down on market days.</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>After he was hanged, the body of William Cragh was carried to the house of Thomas Mathews, a burgess (townsman) of Swansea. His body lay here, bloody and disfigured, with his eyes hanging from their sockets and the tongue swollen out of his mouth. Adam of Loughor, aged around 13 at the time, tells us he was too scared to look at the body. And yet, to everyone&rsquo;s amazement, William Cragh began to come back to life. Many witnesses came to see this and Lady Mary de Briouze &ndash; wife of Lord William who had ordered the execution &ndash; sent a maidservant with nourishing almond milk to help Cragh recover. Was it a miracle?</p>

									<p><p>We don&rsquo;t know the exact location of the house of Thomas Mathews in medieval Swansea &ndash; and we don&rsquo;t know who once wore this tiny bronze button. The button could have slipped from the clothing of any reasonably well-to-do citizen of medieval Swansea: it&rsquo;s something quite ordinary and quite small, but which suggests an intimate and direct connection with an unknown man or woman in the medieval past of Swansea and the Gower.</p></p>
