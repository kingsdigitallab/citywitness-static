								<p>Standing here in the Middle Ages, with the castle rising steeply behind you, you would have been at the very edge of the River Tawe (as the name &lsquo;Strand&rsquo; suggests). The river was much wider in the medieval period, before a new channel was cut in the 19th century. The area below you (where the footbridge runs across to the retail park) would have been under water! Here you would have been in the midst of a bustling harbour, with boats unloading their wares and coming in for repair. You may want to reach the next tour location (Market place) by walking (south-east) along the modern street called the Strand, and turning right up Green Dragon Lane, a medieval street.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Maritime trade was the key to medieval Swansea&rsquo;s prosperity as a town and a port. The place in the town where ships were moored was the Strand, the name meaning beach or shore. The modern road called Strand indicates the medieval line of the banks of the Tawe where ships could be taken out of the river either for unloading or repairs. Goods brought to Swansea by sea would have entered the town through the streets leading up from the Strand. Several narrow alleys still survive, such as Green Dragon Lane, connecting the Strand to the town&rsquo;s main medieval market place in Wind Street. Historical documents and archaeological evidence show that by the 13th century Swansea had a thriving coastal business to areas such as North Devon and ports such as Bristol. Luxury goods such as wine were imported from France for the wealthier members of Swansea&rsquo;s medieval population. Improvements to the river in the 19th century resulted in the creation of the New Cut in 1843 which moved the river to its present course.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>The North Gate was in the town walls on Swansea&rsquo;s High Street, and many of the witnesses to the William Cragh story passed through the Gate as they moved between key locations. Lord William&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, goes through the Gate repeatedly as he visits Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to see Cragh&rsquo;s body and reports back to his master in the Castle. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maidservants, Jovanta or Sunehild, also pass through the North Gate on their way to take almond milk to the recovering William Cragh.</p>

									<p><p>This impressive sword speaks of the ever-present reality of violence in medieval Swansea. The North Gate was a point where entry to the walled town was controlled, serving to protect the city against attack. John of Baggeham, steward of William de Briouze in 1290, tells us how he and a band of other men carry arms with them to ensure that the power of the Anglo-Norman lord is enforced and the town is kept under control.</p></p>
