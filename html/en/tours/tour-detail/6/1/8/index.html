								<p>The ruins of Swansea Castle are the most striking reminder of the city&rsquo;s medieval heritage. This is actually the &lsquo;New&rsquo; Castle, built in the late 13th century to replace the &lsquo;Old&rsquo; Castle (founded around 1106) nearby. The castle displayed the power and status of the Anglo-Norman de Briouze family, who ruled Swansea and the Marcher Lordship of Gower. As well as a large hall on the first floor, the castle boasted an inside latrine (toilet), and also contained a dungeon where criminals and opponents of Anglo-Norman rule were held. A surviving document tells us that the dungeon was supplied with new locks and keys in 1535. In the 18th century, a debtors&rsquo; prison was housed in the large square tower of the castle.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">New Castle was designed to replace the Old Castle, and work on it started around 1284-90 under the lordship of William de Briouze II. The distinctive arcading seen high up on the standing walls was added by John, Lord of Mowbray (1331-54). Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle reflects a period of relative peace with few raids or wars. Being designed to provide comfortable living and working space, the New Castle had well-appointed private rooms with an inside toilet (latrine) that emptied into the moat. There was also a grand entertainment and business area &ndash; a hall &ndash; located on the first floor with a series of basements below. By this time there is also evidence that housing for wealthier residents of Swansea stood in the outer ward of the castle. This area was cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to expose the ruins of the castle and to create Castle Square.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The parish church for medieval Swansea, St Mary&rsquo;s benefited from the patronage of the de Briouze family. We know that Lady Mary de Briouze &ndash; wife of the Lord William who ordered the hanging of the Welshman William Cragh &ndash; was a religious and devout woman, and we can imagine her visiting St Mary&rsquo;s for services and prayer. While the medieval structure of St Mary&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t survive today, the story of William Cragh also gives us other clues about what might have been there. For example, while Cragh is in the dungeons of Swansea Castle before his hanging, he reports seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary. But he says that she wasn&rsquo;t holding her son, the Christ child, &lsquo;as material images concerning her represent&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s possible that Cragh was thinking of pictures of Mary which he had seen in Swansea&rsquo;s parish church, itself dedicated to her. Wall paintings and statues of Mary were very common in Wales at this time.</p>

									<p><p>This carved stone head was found at the site of the old Rectory House in Fisher Street, Swansea in the late 19th century and is thought to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally believed to depict Alina de Mowbray, daughter of Lord William de Briouze (junior) who testified in 1307 as a witness to the hanging of William Cragh. Alina&rsquo;s own life was colourful and her fortunes very changeable. Today, she is remembered as the ghostly &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo; of Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles.&nbsp;</p></p>
