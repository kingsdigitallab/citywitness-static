								<p>St Mary&rsquo;s was the parish church of medieval Swansea. The church was probably first built in the 12th century, and remodelled in 1739 (though the tower and side chapel of the older church were retained). In the 19th century, the local writer Samuel Gamwell &ndash; a keen historian and conservationist &ndash; bemoaned the jumbled architectural style of the church. In a verse, he writes:<br /><br />The Vicar he vowed, as he peeped round his pulpit:<br />&lsquo;Throughout the broad land you may carefully search,<br />But you nowhere will find so consummately ugly,<br />So rickety, ramshackle, wretched a Church,<br />As this pitiful patchwork, St Mary&rsquo;s of Swansea&hellip;&rsquo;<br /><br />However, St Mary&rsquo;s was almost completely destroyed in the Swansea Blitz and the present building dates from the 1950s.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">The church of St Mary was the parish church for medieval Swansea. It was first recorded in 1291 but was probably built originally in the 12th century when this part of the town was first developed. The building has changed much over the centuries, which means little is known about its appearance in the Middle Ages. The church was rebuilt in 1739, although the tower and side chapel of the older church was retained. Elements of the medieval church were recorded and showed evidence of mid-late 13th century architecture prior to its rebuilding between 1895 and 1899. St Mary&rsquo;s was badly damaged in the Second World War, destroying the remaining medieval fabric. The new church was built between 1954-59, with only the stone effigy of a priest and the 15th century tomb brass to Sir Hugh Johnys and his wife as a link to its medieval past.&nbsp;</p>
