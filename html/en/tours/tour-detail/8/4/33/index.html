								<p>At the same time as the area around St Mary&rsquo;s Church was developed, it is likely too that High Street became built-up north of the castle. High Street was the main land route into the town, and led right up to the castle gates and Old Castle. The street was a suburb in the thirteenth century and it extended northwards for some considerable distance. The street was wide and could have been used for trading, and certainly its position as a main route in the town would have meant properties a long it would have been desirable as sites for shops and merchants&rsquo; houses. When High Street was first built up, perhaps in the early-13th century, perhaps earlier, it was not defended, but later, by the 14th century the town&rsquo;s walls cut across High Street at King Street, dividing the suburb in two, creating High Street and Upper High Street. A gate was built across the street too, North Gate.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">High Street was the main road into medieval Swansea from the north. It was an important route and also a long street fronted with houses, some of which stood in the walled town and others outside, in a suburb of the medieval town. North Gate was the divide. This whole area of High Street was probably established in the later 12th&nbsp;century as Swansea prospered and outgrew the area of the earlier Norman town around Wind Street. Despite the major changes Swansea has seen in the past two centuries, it is remarkable that along High Street the remains of some medieval house-plots still survive, even though the buildings themselves have are modern.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>Running north through the town, the High Street was the main route between Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle and the probable location of the house of Thomas Mathews, near the Chapel of St John. It was in the house of Thomas Mathews that William Cragh&rsquo;s body was laid after the hanging &ndash; and where he gradually revived. Lord William de Briouze&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, made the journey along the High Street repeatedly as he hurried between the Castle and Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to observe and report on the situation. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maids also went back and forth along the High Street with broth and almond milk for the recovering Cragh.</p>

									<p><p>These stones would have been used for grinding corn to mill flour, an important commodity for trade and consumption in medieval Swansea. A Swansea charter in the 12th century gives all burgesses the right to have their own oven for baking bread, although they were not allowed to grind corn in their own houses. This meant that they had to use the lord&rsquo;s mill and pay for the privilege!</p></p>
