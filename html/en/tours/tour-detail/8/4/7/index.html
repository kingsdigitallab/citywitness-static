								<p>At the same time as the area around St Mary&rsquo;s Church was developed, it is likely too that High Street became built-up north of the castle. High Street was the main land route into the town, and led right up to the castle gates and Old Castle. The street was a suburb in the thirteenth century and it extended northwards for some considerable distance. The street was wide and could have been used for trading, and certainly its position as a main route in the town would have meant properties a long it would have been desirable as sites for shops and merchants&rsquo; houses. When High Street was first built up, perhaps in the early-13th century, perhaps earlier, it was not defended, but later, by the 14th century the town&rsquo;s walls cut across High Street at King Street, dividing the suburb in two, creating High Street and Upper High Street. A gate was built across the street too, North Gate.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">High Street was the main road into medieval Swansea from the north. It was an important route and also a long street fronted with houses, some of which stood in the walled town and others outside, in a suburb of the medieval town. North Gate was the divide. This whole area of High Street was probably established in the later 12th&nbsp;century as Swansea prospered and outgrew the area of the earlier Norman town around Wind Street. Despite the major changes Swansea has seen in the past two centuries, it is remarkable that along High Street the remains of some medieval house-plots still survive, even though the buildings themselves have are modern.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>Adam of Loughor was a 13-year-old boy in 1290, when the Welsh rebel William Cragh was hanged in Swansea. Interviewed by representatives of the pope years later, Adam remembers that he sat on Swansea&rsquo;s town walls to get a good view of the hanging. Adam&rsquo;s story reminds us that executions served as popular spectacle in the Middle Ages &ndash; a tense and complex mix of entertainment and reminder of the lord&rsquo;s power and vengeance. Although Adam sought out the walls as a good vantage-point to watch the hanging, he wasn&rsquo;t so happy about seeing Cragh&rsquo;s dead body close up. He tells us that, later, he was too scared to look at Cragh&rsquo;s bloodied corpse when it lay in the house of Thomas Mathews.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea was often under siege. This cannon ball reminds us of the many attacks which the town walls had to withstand, and their important role in protecting the town&rsquo;s inhabitants. Tradition holds that this particular cannon ball was used later, in Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s attack on Swansea Castle in the Civil War (1648).&nbsp;</p></p>
