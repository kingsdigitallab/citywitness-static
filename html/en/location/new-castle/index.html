			<h1>New Castle </h1>
                        <p><p>The remains of the New Castle are one of Swansea's most visible medieval survivals.</p></p>
                    <p><p class="MsoNormal">New Castle was designed to replace the Old Castle, and work on it started around 1284-90 under the lordship of William de Briouze II. The distinctive arcading seen high up on the standing walls was added by John, Lord of Mowbray (1331-54). Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle reflects a period of relative peace with few raids or wars. Being designed to provide comfortable living and working space, the New Castle had well-appointed private rooms with an inside toilet (latrine) that emptied into the moat. There was also a grand entertainment and business area &ndash; a hall &ndash; located on the first floor with a series of basements below. By this time there is also evidence that housing for wealthier residents of Swansea stood in the outer ward of the castle. This area was cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to expose the ruins of the castle and to create Castle Square.&nbsp;</p></p>
            <p><p>When the Welshman William Cragh was hanged in 1290, the New Castle was the Swansea home of the de Briouze family. Lord William de Briouze, the son of the Lord William who ordered the hanging, tells us in his witness testimony that he (and his guests) watched the hanging from the windows of the Castle hall. They were able to see the broken crossbeam of the gibbet and William Cragh hanged for a second time. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that she and her maidservants and other companions were in the Castle praying to St Thomas de Cantilupe for Wililam Cragh&rsquo;s life to be spared. We don&rsquo;t know why Mary was so keen for Cragh to be saved.</p></p>
