			<h1>The Dungeon </h1>
                        <p><p>The dungeons of Swansea Castle have a long and intriguing history.</p></p>
                    <p><p class="MsoNormal">There are references to the dungeon at the castle in 1322, 1400 and 1535 when it was provided with new locks and keys. Despite this where the dungeon was located in Swansea Castle is not known. A later prison for debtors was established in the square tower set in the defensive wall surrounding the castle. In the medieval period, the view from this tower would have looked over the Strand and the River Tawe to the open fields and hills on the opposite bank. In the 18th century the upper floor of the tower was modified to serve as the debtors&rsquo; prison, re-establishing the centuries-old link between the Castle and the detention of prisoners involved in rebellions such as William Cragh&rsquo;s attack on Swansea and Oystermouth Castles in 1287.&nbsp;</p></p>
            <p><p>William Cragh was held in the dungeons of Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle before he was led to Gibbet Hill to be hanged. While in the dungeons, he tells us that he had a vision of a man robed in white, whom he believed to be St Thomas de Cantilupe. He also saw a vision of the Virgin Mary, who gave him a sign that he would be saved. While in the dungeon, Cragh &lsquo;bent a penny to St Thomas&rsquo; &ndash; a way of asking for the saint&rsquo;s help and promising to honour him if he was spared.</p></p>
