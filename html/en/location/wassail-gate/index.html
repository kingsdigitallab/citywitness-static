			<h1>St Mary&#39;s Square  (Formerly Wassail Gate)</h1>
                        <p><p>The south side of St Mary's Square formed an important medieval street, Frog Street, leading to the Wassail Gate.</p></p>
                    <p><p class="MsoNormal">The Wassail Gate no longer stands but in medieval Swansea it was one of the main gates into the walled town. North from Wassail Gate the stone-built town walls ran to West Gate and from there around to North Gate. South from Wassail Gate the town&rsquo;s defences consisted of the river Cadle, named the Town Ditch in some documents, and possibly also an earth bank. Wassail Gate was maintained by town council until the 18th century and outside lay an area called Wassail Square, possibly an open space used as a fair or occasional market for specific goods such as livestock.&nbsp;</p></p>
            <p><p>Wassail Gate was one of the main gates into the walled town of Swansea in the Middle Ages. It was also the start of the road to Gower, where many of the participants in the story of the hanging of William Cragh lived or came from. William Cragh himself was from Llanrhidian, though he tells us that his own lands had been taken away by his lord and he relied on the help of his friends. (Other medieval documents prove that this really did happen &ndash; Cragh had good reason to hate Lord William de Briouze.) As his name suggests, Adam of Loughor probably originally came from Loughor, across the Gower peninsula, near Llanelli.</p></p>
