			<h1>College Street  (Formerly West Gate)</h1>
                        <p><p>West Gate was the gate leading out from the northern half of the town.</p></p>
                    <p><p class="MsoNormal">The town&rsquo;s West Gate stood on the main road leading out from Swansea to the Gower, along modern Gower Street. The gate has long gone but it was set in the town wall which ran around the west side of medieval Swansea. It stood somewhere at the junction of College Street, Princess Way, Kingsway and Orchard Street. Of these streets, Princess Way is a 1950s creation, replacing the medieval Goat Street which ran along the western side of the Castle. In the 14th century the area outside West Gate was open fields and a stream ran parallel to the town walls which fed a small pond which by the 18th century was known as the Washing Lake. This may have been the place where the folk from the town came to do their laundry.</p></p>
            <p><p>On the morning of the execution, William Cragh and Trahaearn ap Hywel, the other condemned man, were led out of the West Gate towards Gibbet Hill. The priest Thomas Marshall tells us that Cragh wore a shirt and breeches; Trahaearn was in a tunic with his hands tied behind his back. Another priest, William Codineston, walked with the condemned men. He tells us that Cragh wanted to make a confession &ndash; but Codineston didn&rsquo;t speak Welsh and couldn&rsquo;t help. William Codineston also tells us that he left the execution posse as it passed through the Gate as he didn&rsquo;t think it was appropriate for him to follow &lsquo;due to his status as a priest&rsquo;.</p></p>
