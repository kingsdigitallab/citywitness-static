			<h1>Welcome Lane  (Formerly East Gate)</h1>
                        <p><p>East Gate was a part of the Castle defences and provided access to the Strand.</p></p>
                    <p><p class="MsoNormal">The site of East Gate is uncertain but it probably stood at the bottom of Welcome Lane controlling access to and from the river and the Strand. The higher ground on which the castle stands would have formed a natural defence but the gate helped to defend the town further.&nbsp;</p></p>
            <p><p>Swansea&rsquo;s walls and gates, like the East Gate, were a symbol of Anglo-Norman power and authority, and were viewed with mixed feelings by Welsh people. William Cragh was a rebel accused of involvement in the burning of Oystermouth Castle, but we also know that he was active and known in the local town community of Swansea. Medieval Welsh texts give us some glimpses of the conflicting attitudes Welsh people had to Swansea. Swansea is called a &lsquo;town of broken towers&rsquo; where the women are &lsquo;altogether widows&rsquo; as a result of Welsh raids. But the town is also praised as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;.</p></p>
