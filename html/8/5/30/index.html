								<p>Swansea had town walls by the middle of the 14th century, built of stone, at least for a part of their length, with gates for the streets in and out. The town walls were not built around the whole of the town but just for the part immediately around the castle area, as if the town walls were really a way of creating an outer set of defences for the New Castle that was also being built at this time (to replace the Old Castle). The town walls cut through High Street, and ran behind house-plots in Goat Street, then along the side of St Mary&rsquo;s Church, to link up with the town ditch that was created to defend the area of Frog Street and Fisher Street to the south. The town gates have all gone, but from archaeological research and by studying the town&rsquo;s street pattern it is possible to work out where the gates were, as well as the circuit of the walls.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Medieval Swansea was a walled town. The line of walls is in part recalled by the name Whitewalls and ran on the western (inland) side of the town connecting West Gate and Wassail Gate. The walls here were made of stone. Historical documents refer to a tax in 1317 for the upkeep of the walls while archaeology has shown that the stone defences may be contemporary with the rebuilding of the castle in the late 13th&nbsp;century. At the corner of Whitewalls and St Mary&rsquo;s Square, the wall was shown to be 1.9 metres thick, faced with sandstone blocks. In front of the wall was a ditch about 6 metres wide and 2 metres deep. The line of the defences around the town can be followed by walking along the street still called Whitewalls.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>Swansea&rsquo;s South Gate led down towards the Cadle stream and the marshy land beyond. Even here, the raised, imposing structure of the Castle would have been visible, showing the power and control of the Anglo-Norman Marcher lords, who acted quickly to crush and punish acts of rebellion such as the burning of Oystermouth Castle, with which William Cragh was involved.</p>

This jug must once have been at the centre of many convivial scenes, as people in medieval Swansea shared drinks, stories and laughter.</p></p>
