								<p>Old Castle is no longer visible but was the site of Swansea&rsquo;s first castle, built in around 1100. The castle itself was a motte and bailey, covering quite a large site and connected on one side to the market place and Wind Street. The castle was enclosed on all four sides by natural defences, but these were also strengthened by walls and gates. It is possible that the outer part of the castle enclosure, the bailey, was used to control traffic coming into and out of the market place, passing before the lord&rsquo;s eyes. If there was a town at Swansea before the Normans, their castle may have been built upon house-plots and streets, as happened elsewhere at this time, at Norwich for example. By-passing the castle was made possible by using Goat Street, which skirts to the west of the castle, or Strand to the east, avoiding the lord&rsquo;s prying eyes.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Old Castle was the location of Swansea&rsquo;s first castle, founded around 1106. It was a motte and bailey castle, now disappeared from the modern townscape. At the time it was built, the castle would have been seen as a symbol of Norman power in a Welsh landscape. The castle was divided into two parts, known as wards or baileys, with a ditch and timber palisade for the defences and two gates. One gate stood on the north side of the castle, leading to High Street, and the other on the south, adjacent to the later New Castle. The outer ward of Old Castle contained many of the buildings needed for its upkeep. The inner ward was the defensive heart of the castle with its own wall and ditch surrounding an earthen mound (motte) topped by a keep. In 1216 the castle passed into the control of the de Briouze family, and in 1221 John de Briouze repaired and rebuilt the castle in stone. In 1845, the remains of the late 13<span style="font-size: 8px;">th</span>&nbsp;century High Street gate were found and revealed an impressive building with two towers either side of the entrance. In more recent years archaeologists have also found sections of the castle ditch near College Street and in Princess Way.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On an autumn day in the year 1290, William Cragh was hanged on Gibbet Hill by William de Briouze, the Anglo-Norman lord of Gower. Cragh was hanged as a rebel and criminal, together with another Welshman, Trahaearn ap Hywel. In an act of particular cruelty, Lord William forced Cragh&rsquo;s own friends and family to perform the hanging. Cragh was lifted onto the gibbet first, and then Trahaearn was pulled up by a rope slung over the crossbeam. But one medieval witness at the execution tells us that Trahaearn was &lsquo;big and heavy&rsquo;, and this caused the gibbet to break. Cragh and Trahaearn were hanged for a second time and seemed to be dead. But was that really the case?</p>
