								<p>By the mid-14th century, medieval Swansea had reached its maximum size and remained like this until the 1800s. This does not mean that the urban landscape stopped changing, however. New buildings were constructed after 1300, such as the town walls and gates, New Castle, and St David&rsquo;s Hospital. These were all significant building projects, showing that there was money in Swansea at this time to fund these works, as well as a desire by the lord and the townspeople to use them to show off the status of the town to traders and visitors. St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important medieval landmarks. Now a public house, it is a good place to end the tour of the development of Swansea and reflect on how much the town has changed through the centuries.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important standing medieval buildings. The present Cross Keys pub incorporates parts of a 14th century building that was the hospital of the Blessed David of Swegnar, founded in 1332. Medieval hospitals were religious institutions, and St David&rsquo;s was staffed by six chaplains to provide a home and care for sick and infirm clergy and laymen. The hospital stood in a prominent and important location in the medieval town and the surviving buildings show it was well appointed with residential areas and a communal hall. It had a garden for growing food. From the remains of rubbish disposed there, archaeologists have shown that residents lived very comfortably, enjoying fine imported wines and goods from France, reflecting the wealth and status of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>After William Cragh was hanged, his friends carried his apparently lifeless body to the Chapel of St John. This may have been because the Chapel had a long-standing association with the Welsh community, and it was located outside the town walls. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that Cragh&rsquo;s body was transported on a kind of wooden wheel, which in itself would have caused great injury. The different medieval witnesses don&rsquo;t agree on what happened when Cragh&rsquo;s body arrived at the Chapel of St John. It seems likely that the Chapel was closed, and Cragh&rsquo;s body was then carried to the nearby house of Thomas Mathews.</p>
