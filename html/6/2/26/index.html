								<p>Standing here in the Middle Ages, with the castle rising steeply behind you, you would have been at the very edge of the River Tawe (as the name &lsquo;Strand&rsquo; suggests). The river was much wider in the medieval period, before a new channel was cut in the 19th century. The area below you (where the footbridge runs across to the retail park) would have been under water! Here you would have been in the midst of a bustling harbour, with boats unloading their wares and coming in for repair. You may want to reach the next tour location (Market place) by walking (south-east) along the modern street called the Strand, and turning right up Green Dragon Lane, a medieval street.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Maritime trade was the key to medieval Swansea&rsquo;s prosperity as a town and a port. The place in the town where ships were moored was the Strand, the name meaning beach or shore. The modern road called Strand indicates the medieval line of the banks of the Tawe where ships could be taken out of the river either for unloading or repairs. Goods brought to Swansea by sea would have entered the town through the streets leading up from the Strand. Several narrow alleys still survive, such as Green Dragon Lane, connecting the Strand to the town&rsquo;s main medieval market place in Wind Street. Historical documents and archaeological evidence show that by the 13th century Swansea had a thriving coastal business to areas such as North Devon and ports such as Bristol. Luxury goods such as wine were imported from France for the wealthier members of Swansea&rsquo;s medieval population. Improvements to the river in the 19th century resulted in the creation of the New Cut in 1843 which moved the river to its present course.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Here, in what is probably the oldest part of Swansea, was the town&rsquo;s main market place. The site was close to the castle and the power of the Anglo-Norman lords. Food, clothes and other goods would have been traded here. One of the witnesses to the hanging of William Cragh has the name Henry Skinner, which suggests that he may have been involved in the local leather trade. It&rsquo;s possible that other places were also used for trading and occasional markets. The Welshman John ap Hywel tells us that he watched the hanging of William Cragh from a &lsquo;platea&rsquo; (an open space or square) by St Mary&rsquo;s Church. This may have been the open area just outside the Wassail Gate, near St Mary&rsquo;s, which has many features typical of market places in medieval towns. This may have been an alternative market place used by the local Welsh community.</p>

									<p><p>This coin may well have changed hands in Swansea&rsquo;s marketplace, located at the upper end of Wind Street. Goods of all kinds were sold here, and the trade in hides and leather goods was particularly important in medieval Swansea. A late 12th-century charter granted to the burgesses by William de Beaumont included a clause banning foreign merchants from selling cloth in Swansea or buying skins from anyone other than citizens of the town. This was a way of protecting and supporting the local economy.</p></p>
