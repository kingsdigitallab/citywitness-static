								<p>Now incorporated into the Cross Keys Pub, St David&rsquo;s Hospital is another of Swansea&rsquo;s visible medieval buildings. Founded in 1332, it housed elderly and infirm clergy and laymen, and included residential areas, a communal hall and a garden. Like the New Castle, St David&rsquo;s Hospital is a rare survival of the city&rsquo;s medieval past. Many of Swansea&rsquo;s historic buildings, and the lay-out of its medieval streets, were destroyed in the Three Nights Blitz of 1941 &ndash; as well as in the subsequent clearing and re-development of the town centre.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important standing medieval buildings. The present Cross Keys pub incorporates parts of a 14th century building that was the hospital of the Blessed David of Swegnar, founded in 1332. Medieval hospitals were religious institutions, and St David&rsquo;s was staffed by six chaplains to provide a home and care for sick and infirm clergy and laymen. The hospital stood in a prominent and important location in the medieval town and the surviving buildings show it was well appointed with residential areas and a communal hall. It had a garden for growing food. From the remains of rubbish disposed there, archaeologists have shown that residents lived very comfortably, enjoying fine imported wines and goods from France, reflecting the wealth and status of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On an autumn day in the year 1290, William Cragh was hanged on Gibbet Hill by William de Briouze, the Anglo-Norman lord of Gower. Cragh was hanged as a rebel and criminal, together with another Welshman, Trahaearn ap Hywel. In an act of particular cruelty, Lord William forced Cragh&rsquo;s own friends and family to perform the hanging. Cragh was lifted onto the gibbet first, and then Trahaearn was pulled up by a rope slung over the crossbeam. But one medieval witness at the execution tells us that Trahaearn was &lsquo;big and heavy&rsquo;, and this caused the gibbet to break. Cragh and Trahaearn were hanged for a second time and seemed to be dead. But was that really the case?</p>
