								<p>Swansea&rsquo;s main market place was held at the top of Wind Street. Food, clothes and household items would be traded here. Archaeological finds show that fine imported wine was drunk in Swansea in the Middle Ages. Trade in leather and hides was also an important part of the local economy. At the bottom of Wind Street, the South Gate led out to marshland and a ferry across the Tawe. At the top of the street, the Castle loomed large.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">For medieval Swansea, like all medieval towns, the market place was its commercial core, where traders gathered. The market place in Wind Street is probably the earliest part of medieval Swansea, perhaps laid out at the same time the castle was first built, in around 1100. Its location, beneath the castle, meant it could be watched closely by the Lords of the Gower. By 1300 it was perhaps home to some of its wealthiest residents. Swansea had a weekly market and two yearly fairs, and on other days the market place was used for meetings and street entertainment during religious festivals. Food was one of the main goods sold, as well as clothes and household items. These were sold from stalls and booths which could be set up and taken down on market days.</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The Hospital of St David was founded after the hanging of William Cragh, in 1332 (Cragh was hanged in 1290). But the values of the Hospital reflect medieval traditions of charity, alms-giving and care for the sick and poor which we also glimpse in the story of William Cragh. Lady Mary de Briouze, wife of the Lord William who orders Cragh&rsquo;s execution, performs acts of charity often associated with medieval noblewomen by sending almond milk and broth to help nourish Cragh after the hanging. There&rsquo;s a fascinating tension here between Mary&rsquo;s duty to support her husband&rsquo;s rule as Marcher lord, and her Christian obligation to support the vulnerable members of Swansea&rsquo;s community.</p>
