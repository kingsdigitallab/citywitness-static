								<p>Swansea&rsquo;s main market place was held at the top of Wind Street. Food, clothes and household items would be traded here. Archaeological finds show that fine imported wine was drunk in Swansea in the Middle Ages. Trade in leather and hides was also an important part of the local economy. At the bottom of Wind Street, the South Gate led out to marshland and a ferry across the Tawe. At the top of the street, the Castle loomed large.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">For medieval Swansea, like all medieval towns, the market place was its commercial core, where traders gathered. The market place in Wind Street is probably the earliest part of medieval Swansea, perhaps laid out at the same time the castle was first built, in around 1100. Its location, beneath the castle, meant it could be watched closely by the Lords of the Gower. By 1300 it was perhaps home to some of its wealthiest residents. Swansea had a weekly market and two yearly fairs, and on other days the market place was used for meetings and street entertainment during religious festivals. Food was one of the main goods sold, as well as clothes and household items. These were sold from stalls and booths which could be set up and taken down on market days.</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Running north through the town, the High Street was the main route between Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle and the probable location of the house of Thomas Mathews, near the Chapel of St John. It was in the house of Thomas Mathews that William Cragh&rsquo;s body was laid after the hanging &ndash; and where he gradually revived. Lord William de Briouze&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, made the journey along the High Street repeatedly as he hurried between the Castle and Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to observe and report on the situation. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maids also went back and forth along the High Street with broth and almond milk for the recovering Cragh.</p>

									<p><p>These stones would have been used for grinding corn to mill flour, an important commodity for trade and consumption in medieval Swansea. A Swansea charter in the 12th century gives all burgesses the right to have their own oven for baking bread, although they were not allowed to grind corn in their own houses. This meant that they had to use the lord&rsquo;s mill and pay for the privilege!</p></p>
