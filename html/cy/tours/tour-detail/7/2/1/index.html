								<p>William Cragh, the Welshman hanged by Lord William de Briouze in 1290, spent the night before his execution here with other condemned men. The castle dungeons were a place of suffering and despair, where criminals and opponents of the Anglo-Norman regime were held. Later, in the 18th century, part of Swansea Castle became a debtors&rsquo; prison. Is this place still haunted by the pleas and moans of the unfortunate individuals who languished here?</p>

								<p>Mae cyfeiriadau i ddaeargelloedd y castell ym 1322, 1400 a 1535 pan gawsant gloeon ac allweddi newydd. Ond er gwaethaf hyn, nid ydym yn gwybod lle'r oedd y ddaeargell yng Nghastell Abertawe. Sefydlwyd carchar diweddarach ar gyfer dyledwyr yn nhŵr sgw&acirc;r y wal amddiffynnol a oedd o amgylch y castell. Yn yr Oesoedd Canol, byddai gan y tŵr hwn olygfeydd o'r Strand ac afon Tawe gyda'r caeau agored a'r bryniau ar yr ochr arall. Yn y 18fed ganrif addaswyd llawr uchaf y tŵr yn garchar dyledwyr, gan ailsefydlu'r hen gysylltiad rhwng y Castell &acirc; chosbi carcharwyr a oedd yn rhan o wrthryfeloedd, megis ymosodiad William Cragh ar Gastell Abertawe a Chastell Ystumllwynarth ym 1287.</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>After William Cragh was hanged, his friends carried his apparently lifeless body to the Chapel of St John. This may have been because the Chapel had a long-standing association with the Welsh community, and it was located outside the town walls. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that Cragh&rsquo;s body was transported on a kind of wooden wheel, which in itself would have caused great injury. The different medieval witnesses don&rsquo;t agree on what happened when Cragh&rsquo;s body arrived at the Chapel of St John. It seems likely that the Chapel was closed, and Cragh&rsquo;s body was then carried to the nearby house of Thomas Mathews.</p>
