								<p>In 1290, the house of Thomas Mathews was near the Chapel of St John. &lsquo;Thomas Mathews&rsquo; is just one of the names of ordinary inhabitants of Swansea which survive in medieval charters and other documents. It was to Thomas&rsquo;s house that the body of William Cragh was brought after his hanging in 1290 &ndash; other than that, we know nothing about him. The object linked to this location is a medieval bronze button. Again, this tiny everyday item connects us to the anonymous individual who once wore it: an &lsquo;unknown citizen&rsquo; of medieval Gower who stands for all those who lived out their lives here, and whose stories whisper to us across the centuries.</p>

								<p>Roedd eglwys ganoloesol Sant Ioan yng nghanol caeau agored ar gyrion gogleddol tref gaerog Abertawe. Dyma lle mae eglwys St Matthew heddiw. Yn &ocirc;l ffynonellau hanesyddol, sefydlwyd yr eglwys gan Farchogion yr Ysbyty yn y 12fed ganrif ac roedd yn gysylltiedig &acirc; phlasty a oedd yn eiddo iddynt. Gwelir o ysgythriad gan Paul Pradley yn y 1790au fod yr eglwys wreiddiol yn llawer llai ac yn adeilad syml si&acirc;p petryal gyda chorff a changell. Mae'r ysgythriad hwn hefyd yn nodi mai caeau a amgylchynai'r eglwys yn bennaf, gydag ychydig o dai wrth y ffordd i Abertawe. Adeiladwyd yr eglwys bresennol yn y 19eg ganrif i ddiwallu anghenion poblogaeth gynyddol Abertawe, ac adeiladwyd tai gweithwyr dros y caeau o amgylch yr eglwys.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Here, in what is probably the oldest part of Swansea, was the town&rsquo;s main market place. The site was close to the castle and the power of the Anglo-Norman lords. Food, clothes and other goods would have been traded here. One of the witnesses to the hanging of William Cragh has the name Henry Skinner, which suggests that he may have been involved in the local leather trade. It&rsquo;s possible that other places were also used for trading and occasional markets. The Welshman John ap Hywel tells us that he watched the hanging of William Cragh from a &lsquo;platea&rsquo; (an open space or square) by St Mary&rsquo;s Church. This may have been the open area just outside the Wassail Gate, near St Mary&rsquo;s, which has many features typical of market places in medieval towns. This may have been an alternative market place used by the local Welsh community.</p>

									<p><p>This coin may well have changed hands in Swansea&rsquo;s marketplace, located at the upper end of Wind Street. Goods of all kinds were sold here, and the trade in hides and leather goods was particularly important in medieval Swansea. A late 12th-century charter granted to the burgesses by William de Beaumont included a clause banning foreign merchants from selling cloth in Swansea or buying skins from anyone other than citizens of the town. This was a way of protecting and supporting the local economy.</p></p>
