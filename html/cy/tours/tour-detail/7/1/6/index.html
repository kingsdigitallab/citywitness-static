								<p>A carved stone head was discovered near here in the late 19th century, and is believed to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally held to depict Lady Alina de Mowbray, daughter of William de Briouze, Lord of Gower, who was born in the late 13th century and died in 1331. Alina was married to John de Mowbray, whose right to rule Gower was contested. John took part in the rebellion of Thomas of Lancaster and was hanged. Legend tells that Alina escaped from Gower by boat to Ilfracombe, but she too was taken to the Tower of London. Eventually, Alina did win the right to possession of the Gower for herself and her heirs, but it had been a hard-won victory. Today, Lady Alina&rsquo;s ghost is said to haunt Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles, where she is known as the &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo;.</p>

								<p>Eglwys y Santes Fair oedd eglwys blwyf Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol. Mae'r cofnod cyntaf ohoni ym 1291, ond mae'n debyg y cafodd ei hadeiladu yn y 12fed ganrif pan ddatblygwyd y rhan hon o'r dref gyntaf. Mae'r adeilad wedi newid llawer dros y blynyddoedd, sy'n golygu mai ychydig yn unig o wybodaeth sydd gennym am sut yr edrychai yn yr Oesoedd Canol. Cafodd yr eglwys ei hailadeiladu ym 1739, ond cadwyd t≈µr a chapel yr hen eglwys. Cofnodwyd rhai elfennau o'r eglwys ganoloesol sy'n dangos fod ganddi nodweddion pensaern&iuml;ol o'r 13eg ganrif cyn y cafodd ei hailadeiladu rhwng 1895 a 1899. Cafodd Eglwys y Santes Fair ei difrodi'n ddifrifol yn yr Ail Ryfel Byd, gan ddinistrio'r elfennau canoloesol a oedd ar &ocirc;l. Adeiladwyd yr eglwys newydd rhwng 1954-59, gydag ond delw garreg o offeiriad a nodweddion pres beddrod Syr Hugh Johnys a'i wraig o'r 15fed ganrif i'n hatgoffa o'i gorffennol canoloesol.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On the morning of the execution, William Cragh and Trahaearn ap Hywel, the other condemned man, were led out of the West Gate towards Gibbet Hill. The priest Thomas Marshall tells us that Cragh wore a shirt and breeches; Trahaearn was in a tunic with his hands tied behind his back. Another priest, William Codineston, walked with the condemned men. He tells us that Cragh wanted to make a confession &ndash; but Codineston didn&rsquo;t speak Welsh and couldn&rsquo;t help. William Codineston also tells us that he left the execution posse as it passed through the Gate as he didn&rsquo;t think it was appropriate for him to follow &lsquo;due to his status as a priest&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea could b a dangerous place, where tensions between different groups and individuals could run high. The road to Gower begins from Swansea&rsquo;s West Gate, making it a particularly likely route into Swansea for the Welsh community outside the mainly Anglo-Norman town. This dagger reminds us of the constant dangers of attack, siege and rebellion in medieval Swansea and the marcher lordship of Gower.</p></p>
