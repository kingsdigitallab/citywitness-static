								<p>A carved stone head was discovered near here in the late 19th century, and is believed to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally held to depict Lady Alina de Mowbray, daughter of William de Briouze, Lord of Gower, who was born in the late 13th century and died in 1331. Alina was married to John de Mowbray, whose right to rule Gower was contested. John took part in the rebellion of Thomas of Lancaster and was hanged. Legend tells that Alina escaped from Gower by boat to Ilfracombe, but she too was taken to the Tower of London. Eventually, Alina did win the right to possession of the Gower for herself and her heirs, but it had been a hard-won victory. Today, Lady Alina&rsquo;s ghost is said to haunt Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles, where she is known as the &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo;.</p>

								<p>Eglwys y Santes Fair oedd eglwys blwyf Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol. Mae'r cofnod cyntaf ohoni ym 1291, ond mae'n debyg y cafodd ei hadeiladu yn y 12fed ganrif pan ddatblygwyd y rhan hon o'r dref gyntaf. Mae'r adeilad wedi newid llawer dros y blynyddoedd, sy'n golygu mai ychydig yn unig o wybodaeth sydd gennym am sut yr edrychai yn yr Oesoedd Canol. Cafodd yr eglwys ei hailadeiladu ym 1739, ond cadwyd tŵr a chapel yr hen eglwys. Cofnodwyd rhai elfennau o'r eglwys ganoloesol sy'n dangos fod ganddi nodweddion pensaern&iuml;ol o'r 13eg ganrif cyn y cafodd ei hailadeiladu rhwng 1895 a 1899. Cafodd Eglwys y Santes Fair ei difrodi'n ddifrifol yn yr Ail Ryfel Byd, gan ddinistrio'r elfennau canoloesol a oedd ar &ocirc;l. Adeiladwyd yr eglwys newydd rhwng 1954-59, gydag ond delw garreg o offeiriad a nodweddion pres beddrod Syr Hugh Johnys a'i wraig o'r 15fed ganrif i'n hatgoffa o'i gorffennol canoloesol.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>Running north through the town, the High Street was the main route between Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle and the probable location of the house of Thomas Mathews, near the Chapel of St John. It was in the house of Thomas Mathews that William Cragh&rsquo;s body was laid after the hanging &ndash; and where he gradually revived. Lord William de Briouze&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, made the journey along the High Street repeatedly as he hurried between the Castle and Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to observe and report on the situation. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maids also went back and forth along the High Street with broth and almond milk for the recovering Cragh.</p>

									<p><p>These stones would have been used for grinding corn to mill flour, an important commodity for trade and consumption in medieval Swansea. A Swansea charter in the 12th century gives all burgesses the right to have their own oven for baking bread, although they were not allowed to grind corn in their own houses. This meant that they had to use the lord&rsquo;s mill and pay for the privilege!</p></p>
