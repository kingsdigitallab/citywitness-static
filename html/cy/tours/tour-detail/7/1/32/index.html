								<p>A carved stone head was discovered near here in the late 19th century, and is believed to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally held to depict Lady Alina de Mowbray, daughter of William de Briouze, Lord of Gower, who was born in the late 13th century and died in 1331. Alina was married to John de Mowbray, whose right to rule Gower was contested. John took part in the rebellion of Thomas of Lancaster and was hanged. Legend tells that Alina escaped from Gower by boat to Ilfracombe, but she too was taken to the Tower of London. Eventually, Alina did win the right to possession of the Gower for herself and her heirs, but it had been a hard-won victory. Today, Lady Alina&rsquo;s ghost is said to haunt Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles, where she is known as the &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo;.</p>

								<p>Eglwys y Santes Fair oedd eglwys blwyf Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol. Mae'r cofnod cyntaf ohoni ym 1291, ond mae'n debyg y cafodd ei hadeiladu yn y 12fed ganrif pan ddatblygwyd y rhan hon o'r dref gyntaf. Mae'r adeilad wedi newid llawer dros y blynyddoedd, sy'n golygu mai ychydig yn unig o wybodaeth sydd gennym am sut yr edrychai yn yr Oesoedd Canol. Cafodd yr eglwys ei hailadeiladu ym 1739, ond cadwyd t≈µr a chapel yr hen eglwys. Cofnodwyd rhai elfennau o'r eglwys ganoloesol sy'n dangos fod ganddi nodweddion pensaern&iuml;ol o'r 13eg ganrif cyn y cafodd ei hailadeiladu rhwng 1895 a 1899. Cafodd Eglwys y Santes Fair ei difrodi'n ddifrifol yn yr Ail Ryfel Byd, gan ddinistrio'r elfennau canoloesol a oedd ar &ocirc;l. Adeiladwyd yr eglwys newydd rhwng 1954-59, gydag ond delw garreg o offeiriad a nodweddion pres beddrod Syr Hugh Johnys a'i wraig o'r 15fed ganrif i'n hatgoffa o'i gorffennol canoloesol.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Wassail Gate was one of the main gates into the walled town of Swansea in the Middle Ages. It was also the start of the road to Gower, where many of the participants in the story of the hanging of William Cragh lived or came from. William Cragh himself was from Llanrhidian, though he tells us that his own lands had been taken away by his lord and he relied on the help of his friends. (Other medieval documents prove that this really did happen &ndash; Cragh had good reason to hate Lord William de Briouze.) As his name suggests, Adam of Loughor probably originally came from Loughor, across the Gower peninsula, near Llanelli.</p>

									<p><p>This characterful fragment of a medieval earthenware jug spout is decorated with a goblin, whose pointed ears stick out at either side of his face. This decoration suggests the humour and playfulness enjoyed by medieval craftspeople and the users of their wares. Just outside Wassail Gate may have been an alternative marketplace for medieval Swansea &ndash; likely the site of occasional festivities &ndash; and the (post-medieval) name &lsquo;Wassail&rsquo; suggests that this Gate may have been associated with merriment and celebration.</p></p>
