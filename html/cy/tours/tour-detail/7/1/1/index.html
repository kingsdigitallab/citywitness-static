								<p>A carved stone head was discovered near here in the late 19th century, and is believed to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally held to depict Lady Alina de Mowbray, daughter of William de Briouze, Lord of Gower, who was born in the late 13th century and died in 1331. Alina was married to John de Mowbray, whose right to rule Gower was contested. John took part in the rebellion of Thomas of Lancaster and was hanged. Legend tells that Alina escaped from Gower by boat to Ilfracombe, but she too was taken to the Tower of London. Eventually, Alina did win the right to possession of the Gower for herself and her heirs, but it had been a hard-won victory. Today, Lady Alina&rsquo;s ghost is said to haunt Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles, where she is known as the &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo;.</p>

								<p>Eglwys y Santes Fair oedd eglwys blwyf Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol. Mae'r cofnod cyntaf ohoni ym 1291, ond mae'n debyg y cafodd ei hadeiladu yn y 12fed ganrif pan ddatblygwyd y rhan hon o'r dref gyntaf. Mae'r adeilad wedi newid llawer dros y blynyddoedd, sy'n golygu mai ychydig yn unig o wybodaeth sydd gennym am sut yr edrychai yn yr Oesoedd Canol. Cafodd yr eglwys ei hailadeiladu ym 1739, ond cadwyd t≈µr a chapel yr hen eglwys. Cofnodwyd rhai elfennau o'r eglwys ganoloesol sy'n dangos fod ganddi nodweddion pensaern&iuml;ol o'r 13eg ganrif cyn y cafodd ei hailadeiladu rhwng 1895 a 1899. Cafodd Eglwys y Santes Fair ei difrodi'n ddifrifol yn yr Ail Ryfel Byd, gan ddinistrio'r elfennau canoloesol a oedd ar &ocirc;l. Adeiladwyd yr eglwys newydd rhwng 1954-59, gydag ond delw garreg o offeiriad a nodweddion pres beddrod Syr Hugh Johnys a'i wraig o'r 15fed ganrif i'n hatgoffa o'i gorffennol canoloesol.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>After William Cragh was hanged, his friends carried his apparently lifeless body to the Chapel of St John. This may have been because the Chapel had a long-standing association with the Welsh community, and it was located outside the town walls. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that Cragh&rsquo;s body was transported on a kind of wooden wheel, which in itself would have caused great injury. The different medieval witnesses don&rsquo;t agree on what happened when Cragh&rsquo;s body arrived at the Chapel of St John. It seems likely that the Chapel was closed, and Cragh&rsquo;s body was then carried to the nearby house of Thomas Mathews.</p>
