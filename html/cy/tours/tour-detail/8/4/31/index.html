								<p>At the same time as the area around St Mary&rsquo;s Church was developed, it is likely too that High Street became built-up north of the castle. High Street was the main land route into the town, and led right up to the castle gates and Old Castle. The street was a suburb in the thirteenth century and it extended northwards for some considerable distance. The street was wide and could have been used for trading, and certainly its position as a main route in the town would have meant properties a long it would have been desirable as sites for shops and merchants&rsquo; houses. When High Street was first built up, perhaps in the early-13th century, perhaps earlier, it was not defended, but later, by the 14th century the town&rsquo;s walls cut across High Street at King Street, dividing the suburb in two, creating High Street and Upper High Street. A gate was built across the street too, North Gate.</p>

								<p>Y Stryd Fawr oedd y brif ffordd i Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol o'r gogledd. Roedd yn llwybr pwysig ac yn stryd hir gyda thai; roedd rhai yn y dref gaerog gyda rhai eraill y tu allan, ym maestref y dref ganoloesol. Y Porth Gogleddol oedd yn eu rhannu. Mae'n debygol y sefydlwyd y Stryd Fawr ar ddiwedd y 12fed ganrif wrth i Abertawe ffynnu a thyfu'r tu hwnt i ardal y dref Normanaidd gynharach a oedd o gwmpas Stryd y Gwynt. Er bod Abertawe wedi newid yn sylweddol dros y ddwy ganrif ddiwethaf, mae'n anhygoel bod olion rhai lleiniau o'r Oesoedd Canol wedi goroesi ar y Stryd Fawr, er bod yr adeiladau eu hunain yn rhai modern.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>In the late 13th century, the Strand ran along the River Tawe, where ships unloaded their goods. Swansea&rsquo;s status as a port and trading city is reflected in Welsh poetry, which celebrates the town as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;. But the strand, and the land around it which sloped down to the river, was overlooked by Swansea Castle and the Anglo-Norman lords who controlled the town. The story of the hanging of William Cragh in 1290 shows us how the ruling de Briouze family were able to look out over the surrounding landscape from the castle, helping them to enforce their power and authority.</p>

									<p><p>In the Middle Ages, the Strand ran along the River Tawe and was a bustling place where ships unloaded their wares and moored for repairs. Not all ships made it safely to harbour: this early medieval pot was brought up from a shipwreck by fishing nets in the 19th century. It reflects medieval Swansea&rsquo;s importance as a trading centre and busy sea-port.</p></p>
