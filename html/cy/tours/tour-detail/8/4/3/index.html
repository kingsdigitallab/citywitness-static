								<p>At the same time as the area around St Mary&rsquo;s Church was developed, it is likely too that High Street became built-up north of the castle. High Street was the main land route into the town, and led right up to the castle gates and Old Castle. The street was a suburb in the thirteenth century and it extended northwards for some considerable distance. The street was wide and could have been used for trading, and certainly its position as a main route in the town would have meant properties a long it would have been desirable as sites for shops and merchants&rsquo; houses. When High Street was first built up, perhaps in the early-13th century, perhaps earlier, it was not defended, but later, by the 14th century the town&rsquo;s walls cut across High Street at King Street, dividing the suburb in two, creating High Street and Upper High Street. A gate was built across the street too, North Gate.</p>

								<p>Y Stryd Fawr oedd y brif ffordd i Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol o'r gogledd. Roedd yn llwybr pwysig ac yn stryd hir gyda thai; roedd rhai yn y dref gaerog gyda rhai eraill y tu allan, ym maestref y dref ganoloesol. Y Porth Gogleddol oedd yn eu rhannu. Mae'n debygol y sefydlwyd y Stryd Fawr ar ddiwedd y 12fed ganrif wrth i Abertawe ffynnu a thyfu'r tu hwnt i ardal y dref Normanaidd gynharach a oedd o gwmpas Stryd y Gwynt. Er bod Abertawe wedi newid yn sylweddol dros y ddwy ganrif ddiwethaf, mae'n anhygoel bod olion rhai lleiniau o'r Oesoedd Canol wedi goroesi ar y Stryd Fawr, er bod yr adeiladau eu hunain yn rhai modern.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>When the Welshman William Cragh was hanged in 1290, the New Castle was the Swansea home of the de Briouze family. Lord William de Briouze, the son of the Lord William who ordered the hanging, tells us in his witness testimony that he (and his guests) watched the hanging from the windows of the Castle hall. They were able to see the broken crossbeam of the gibbet and William Cragh hanged for a second time. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that she and her maidservants and other companions were in the Castle praying to St Thomas de Cantilupe for Wililam Cragh&rsquo;s life to be spared. We don&rsquo;t know why Mary was so keen for Cragh to be saved.</p>

									<p><p>This delicate silver brooch, decorated with cross-hatched collar knots, is perhaps the kind of ornament which might have been worn by Mary de Briouze, Lady of Swansea Castle in the late 13th century. A wealthy noblewoman, Lady Mary would have had access to (relatively) fine clothes and jewellery. But her life was controlled and restricted and often confined to the Castle.</p></p>
