								<p>At the same time as the area around St Mary&rsquo;s Church was developed, it is likely too that High Street became built-up north of the castle. High Street was the main land route into the town, and led right up to the castle gates and Old Castle. The street was a suburb in the thirteenth century and it extended northwards for some considerable distance. The street was wide and could have been used for trading, and certainly its position as a main route in the town would have meant properties a long it would have been desirable as sites for shops and merchants&rsquo; houses. When High Street was first built up, perhaps in the early-13th century, perhaps earlier, it was not defended, but later, by the 14th century the town&rsquo;s walls cut across High Street at King Street, dividing the suburb in two, creating High Street and Upper High Street. A gate was built across the street too, North Gate.</p>

								<p>Y Stryd Fawr oedd y brif ffordd i Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol o'r gogledd. Roedd yn llwybr pwysig ac yn stryd hir gyda thai; roedd rhai yn y dref gaerog gyda rhai eraill y tu allan, ym maestref y dref ganoloesol. Y Porth Gogleddol oedd yn eu rhannu. Mae'n debygol y sefydlwyd y Stryd Fawr ar ddiwedd y 12fed ganrif wrth i Abertawe ffynnu a thyfu'r tu hwnt i ardal y dref Normanaidd gynharach a oedd o gwmpas Stryd y Gwynt. Er bod Abertawe wedi newid yn sylweddol dros y ddwy ganrif ddiwethaf, mae'n anhygoel bod olion rhai lleiniau o'r Oesoedd Canol wedi goroesi ar y Stryd Fawr, er bod yr adeiladau eu hunain yn rhai modern.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On the morning of the execution, William Cragh and Trahaearn ap Hywel, the other condemned man, were led out of the West Gate towards Gibbet Hill. The priest Thomas Marshall tells us that Cragh wore a shirt and breeches; Trahaearn was in a tunic with his hands tied behind his back. Another priest, William Codineston, walked with the condemned men. He tells us that Cragh wanted to make a confession &ndash; but Codineston didn&rsquo;t speak Welsh and couldn&rsquo;t help. William Codineston also tells us that he left the execution posse as it passed through the Gate as he didn&rsquo;t think it was appropriate for him to follow &lsquo;due to his status as a priest&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea could b a dangerous place, where tensions between different groups and individuals could run high. The road to Gower begins from Swansea&rsquo;s West Gate, making it a particularly likely route into Swansea for the Welsh community outside the mainly Anglo-Norman town. This dagger reminds us of the constant dangers of attack, siege and rebellion in medieval Swansea and the marcher lordship of Gower.</p></p>
