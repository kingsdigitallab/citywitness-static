								<p class="p1">Wind Street curves around in an arc and is broad to accommodate medieval Swansea&rsquo;s market. The street may represent the earliest phase of urban development. On east side of the street house plots stretched back to the river and on the west to a ditch, possibly the town&rsquo;s earliest medieval defences linked with the castle. One interpretation of Wind Street and the market is to see it as a late-11th or early-12th century piece of town planning linked to the creation of Old Castle to the north. The castle and town together were a hallmark of Norman colonisation and urban development in Wales and England. A second interpretation of Wind Street is to see it as an area that existed before the Normans. If so, then the possibility exists that the curved Wind Street was originally longer and perhaps even originated at the time of the Vikings.</p>

								<p>Yn Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol, fel y rhan fwyaf o drefi canoloesol, y farchnad oedd y canolbwynt masnachol lle byddai masnachwyr yn ymgasglu. Y farchnad yn Stryd y Gwynt oedd y rhan gynharaf o Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol mwyaf tebyg ac mae'n bosib y cafodd ei sefydlu pan adeiladwyd y castell am y tro cyntaf, tua 1100. Roedd ei lleoliad, islaw'r castell, yn golygu y gallai Arglwyddiaeth GÅµyr gadw llygad barcut arni. Erbyn 1300 mae'n bosib mai dyma lle'r oedd rhai o drigolion cyfoethocaf Abertawe'n byw. Roedd gan Abertawe farchnad wythnosol a dwy ffair y flwyddyn, ac ar ddyddiau eraill byddai'r ardal yn cael ei defnyddio i gynnal cyfarfodydd ac adloniant stryd yn ystod gwyliau crefyddol. Bwyd oedd un o'r prif nwyddau a werthwyd, yn ogystal &acirc; dillad a nwyddau cartref. Byddent yn cael eu gwerthu o stondinau a bythau a g&acirc;i eu gosod yn arbennig ar gyfer dyddiau'r farchnad.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The parish church for medieval Swansea, St Mary&rsquo;s benefited from the patronage of the de Briouze family. We know that Lady Mary de Briouze &ndash; wife of the Lord William who ordered the hanging of the Welshman William Cragh &ndash; was a religious and devout woman, and we can imagine her visiting St Mary&rsquo;s for services and prayer. While the medieval structure of St Mary&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t survive today, the story of William Cragh also gives us other clues about what might have been there. For example, while Cragh is in the dungeons of Swansea Castle before his hanging, he reports seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary. But he says that she wasn&rsquo;t holding her son, the Christ child, &lsquo;as material images concerning her represent&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s possible that Cragh was thinking of pictures of Mary which he had seen in Swansea&rsquo;s parish church, itself dedicated to her. Wall paintings and statues of Mary were very common in Wales at this time.</p>

									<p><p>This carved stone head was found at the site of the old Rectory House in Fisher Street, Swansea in the late 19th century and is thought to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally believed to depict Alina de Mowbray, daughter of Lord William de Briouze (junior) who testified in 1307 as a witness to the hanging of William Cragh. Alina&rsquo;s own life was colourful and her fortunes very changeable. Today, she is remembered as the ghostly &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo; of Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles.&nbsp;</p></p>
