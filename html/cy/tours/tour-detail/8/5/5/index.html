								<p>Swansea had town walls by the middle of the 14th century, built of stone, at least for a part of their length, with gates for the streets in and out. The town walls were not built around the whole of the town but just for the part immediately around the castle area, as if the town walls were really a way of creating an outer set of defences for the New Castle that was also being built at this time (to replace the Old Castle). The town walls cut through High Street, and ran behind house-plots in Goat Street, then along the side of St Mary&rsquo;s Church, to link up with the town ditch that was created to defend the area of Frog Street and Fisher Street to the south. The town gates have all gone, but from archaeological research and by studying the town&rsquo;s street pattern it is possible to work out where the gates were, as well as the circuit of the walls.</p>

								<p>Roedd Abertawe'r Oesoedd Canol yn dref gaerog. Mae'r enw Whitewalls yn atgof rhannol o'r llinell o waliau a oedd yn rhedeg ar ochr orllewinol (mewndirol) y dref gan gysylltu'r Porth Gorllewinol a Phorth Gwasael. Roedd y rhain yn waliau cerrig. Mae dogfennau hanesyddol yn cyfeirio at dreth ym 1317 i gynnal a chadw'r waliau, ond mae gwaith archaeoleg wedi dangos y gallai'r amddiffynfeydd cerrig fod yn rhai mwy cyfoes pan ailadeiladwyd y castell ar ddiwedd y 13eg ganrif. Ar gornel Whitewalls a Sgw&acirc;r y Santes Fair, gwelwyd bod y wal yn 1.9 metr o drwch, gydag arwyneb o flociau tywodfaen. O flaen y wal roedd ffos tua 6 metr o led a 2 metr o ddyfnder. Gellir dilyn olion yr amddiffynfeydd o amgylch y dref trwy gerdded ar hyd stryd a elwir yn Whitewalls o hyd.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>William Cragh was held in the dungeons of Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle before he was led to Gibbet Hill to be hanged. While in the dungeons, he tells us that he had a vision of a man robed in white, whom he believed to be St Thomas de Cantilupe. He also saw a vision of the Virgin Mary, who gave him a sign that he would be saved. While in the dungeon, Cragh &lsquo;bent a penny to St Thomas&rsquo; &ndash; a way of asking for the saint&rsquo;s help and promising to honour him if he was spared.</p>

This folk custom involved bending or folding a coin to invoke a saint and their help. This coin, from the reign of Edward I, recalls the secret ritual practised by Cragh &ndash; which may perhaps have saved his life&hellip;</p></p>
