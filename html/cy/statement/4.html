The idea was that a thread was used to measure the body, and that in the event of a miraculous cure the thread would be made into a votive candle for the saint responsible for the miracle. It was particularly common as a long-range device intended to attract the attention of the saint. For more on this practice, see <a href="4.html#" class="reference" data-id="54">Webb (2000: 74);</a>&nbsp;<a href="4.html#" class="reference" data-id="61" style="display: inline !important;">Finucane (1977</a>);<br />&nbsp;<a href="4.html#" class="reference" data-id="1" style="display: inline !important;">Bartlett (2006</a>: 8-9)<br />&nbsp; and <a href="4.html#" class="reference" data-id="44">Vauchez (1997: 456-7, 490).</a></span>&nbsp; yet, he did not know by whom or according to whose insistence.<span class="pb" data-n="f14r"></span>&nbsp;And after the said measuring, not immediately, but after a pause or even one hour it was said that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>&nbsp;had <a class="event" data-ref="68">moved his tongue</a>&nbsp;a very small amount, and after another pause he <a class="event" data-ref="286">moved one foot</a>, and a little while later little by little he began to recover strength in his limbs. And he lay weak just as it was said for eight or ten days, and was not able to consume [anything] except <a class="event" data-ref="5">broth</a>&nbsp;because he had an inflamed throat and neck.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">The word given here in the Latin literally means &lsquo;suck-up-able&rsquo;. Given the statement of John of Baggeham, it is likely that this broth was made from almonds.
