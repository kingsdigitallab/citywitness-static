<p data-id="p17">&para; Further they asked if the said prayer was extended, and the said measurement taken the same day that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>&nbsp;was hanged.

However, <a class="person" data-ref="1">the said lady</a>&nbsp;added that <a class="person" data-ref="4">the aforesaid William</a>&nbsp;was carried from <a class="location" data-ref="1">the said chapel</a>&nbsp;to the <a class="location" data-ref="10">said locality of Swansea</a>&nbsp;by a means other than that which he had been carried from <a class="location" data-ref="2">the gallows</a>&nbsp;to <a class="location" data-ref="1">the chapel</a>, because it was difficult for those carrying him on a wooden wheel, as she testified above.</p>
<br />
<p data-id="p18">&para; Further, they asked if after the aforesaid measuring of <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>&nbsp;who was hanged had retained in him signs of life [in his body] either on the same day, or on the following day.

<br />
<p data-id="p21">&para; Further they asked if <a class="person" data-ref="4">the said William</a>&nbsp;was living to this [day]. &nbsp;She replied she did not know, because [when] he withdrew from <a class="location" data-ref="11">Hereford</a>&nbsp;he said he wished to go to<a class="location" data-ref="19"> the Holy Land</a>, and afterwards she did not see him.<span class="note" data-type="commentary">Pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the Holy Land was deemed to be the most dangerous (and therefore the most rewarding) of all <a href="2.html#" class="reference" data-id="51">(Sumption, 1975).</a>&nbsp;Perhaps the extent of the miraculous nature of William Cragh&rsquo;s revival was thought to warrant such and extreme journey to truly reflect his thanks. </span>&nbsp;</p>

<p data-id="p24">&para; Further they asked the seventh question of the third article.

<p data-id="p25">&para; Further they asked the eighth question of the third article.

<br />
<p data-id="p26">&para; On the twelfth question of the said third article, concerning the rumour she said that concerning it was as aforesaid [i.e. as described above] and [this] is thus far the voice of the community and common opinion of the people and public rumour, in the said <a class="location" data-ref="9">locality of Gower</a>&nbsp;and of <a class="location" data-ref="11">Hereford</a>, and that at that at time the said miracle was made public,<span class="note" data-type="commentary">A fundamental requirement for the initiation of any inquisitorial or enquiry process called for by the papacy was &lsquo;publica fama&rsquo;.

However, they asked a final question; whether she was related to <a class="person" data-ref="36">the said lord Thomas</a>, and whether her testimony was motivated by prayer, by command, by love, by fear, by hate, by gaining reward she had or would have, and whether she had been taught or instructed to testify, and whether she had agreed on it with other witnesses' depositions?
