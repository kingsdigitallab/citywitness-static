								<p class="MsoNormal">The medieval chapel of St John was located in an area of open fields on the northern outskirts of the walled town of Swansea. Now the site of St Matthew&rsquo;s church, historical sources indicate that the church was founded by Knights Hospitallers in the 12th century and was associated with a manor they owned. An engraving by Paul Padley from the 1790s shows the earlier church was much smaller, consisting of a simple rectangular building, which would have had a nave and chancel. This engraving also shows that the church was largely surrounded by fields, with a few houses close to the road into Swansea. The present church was built in the 19th&nbsp;century to meet the needs of the growing population of Swansea which saw the fields around the church built over with workers housing.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>In the late 13th century, the Strand ran along the River Tawe, where ships unloaded their goods. Swansea&rsquo;s status as a port and trading city is reflected in Welsh poetry, which celebrates the town as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;. But the strand, and the land around it which sloped down to the river, was overlooked by Swansea Castle and the Anglo-Norman lords who controlled the town. The story of the hanging of William Cragh in 1290 shows us how the ruling de Briouze family were able to look out over the surrounding landscape from the castle, helping them to enforce their power and authority.</p>

									<p><p>In the Middle Ages, the Strand ran along the River Tawe and was a bustling place where ships unloaded their wares and moored for repairs. Not all ships made it safely to harbour: this early medieval pot was brought up from a shipwreck by fishing nets in the 19th century. It reflects medieval Swansea&rsquo;s importance as a trading centre and busy sea-port.</p></p>
