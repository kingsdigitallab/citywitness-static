								<p>Finding the Chapel of St John closed, Cragh&rsquo;s friends carried his body to the house of a local townsman, Thomas Mathews. Although we don&rsquo;t know the exact location of Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house, it was close to St John&rsquo;s, and this area of the High Street still shows the pattern of medieval plots fronting the street. While lying in this house, William Cragh gradually came back to life. Was it a miracle?</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Swansea&rsquo;s townsfolk lived in houses fronting onto the town&rsquo;s streets, but what these houses looked like is hard to say. Very few medieval buildings have been excavated in Swansea, but some on Goat Street have. The houses here were timber framed with tiled roofs and decorated ridge tiles. In the William Cragh story, Thomas Matthews&rsquo; house is mentioned, standing close to St John&rsquo;s church. Exactly where his house stood is impossible to say, but interestingly along this part of High Street there are still surviving the patterns of medieval house-plots of the kind that would have been there in Cragh&rsquo;s day. The front of the house-plot in medieval Swansea might be used for shops or workshops, with living accommodation at the rear or on the upper floors. To the rear was a long plot which would have formed a yard, with out-buildings used for storage and perhaps industrial activity, with pits used for toilets and the disposal of rubbish. Here too was space for a vegetable plot and somewhere to keep animals.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Here, in what is probably the oldest part of Swansea, was the town&rsquo;s main market place. The site was close to the castle and the power of the Anglo-Norman lords. Food, clothes and other goods would have been traded here. One of the witnesses to the hanging of William Cragh has the name Henry Skinner, which suggests that he may have been involved in the local leather trade. It&rsquo;s possible that other places were also used for trading and occasional markets. The Welshman John ap Hywel tells us that he watched the hanging of William Cragh from a &lsquo;platea&rsquo; (an open space or square) by St Mary&rsquo;s Church. This may have been the open area just outside the Wassail Gate, near St Mary&rsquo;s, which has many features typical of market places in medieval towns. This may have been an alternative market place used by the local Welsh community.</p>

									<p><p>This coin may well have changed hands in Swansea&rsquo;s marketplace, located at the upper end of Wind Street. Goods of all kinds were sold here, and the trade in hides and leather goods was particularly important in medieval Swansea. A late 12th-century charter granted to the burgesses by William de Beaumont included a clause banning foreign merchants from selling cloth in Swansea or buying skins from anyone other than citizens of the town. This was a way of protecting and supporting the local economy.</p></p>
