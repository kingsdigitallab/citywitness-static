								<p>Finding the Chapel of St John closed, Cragh&rsquo;s friends carried his body to the house of a local townsman, Thomas Mathews. Although we don&rsquo;t know the exact location of Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house, it was close to St John&rsquo;s, and this area of the High Street still shows the pattern of medieval plots fronting the street. While lying in this house, William Cragh gradually came back to life. Was it a miracle?</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Swansea&rsquo;s townsfolk lived in houses fronting onto the town&rsquo;s streets, but what these houses looked like is hard to say. Very few medieval buildings have been excavated in Swansea, but some on Goat Street have. The houses here were timber framed with tiled roofs and decorated ridge tiles. In the William Cragh story, Thomas Matthews&rsquo; house is mentioned, standing close to St John&rsquo;s church. Exactly where his house stood is impossible to say, but interestingly along this part of High Street there are still surviving the patterns of medieval house-plots of the kind that would have been there in Cragh&rsquo;s day. The front of the house-plot in medieval Swansea might be used for shops or workshops, with living accommodation at the rear or on the upper floors. To the rear was a long plot which would have formed a yard, with out-buildings used for storage and perhaps industrial activity, with pits used for toilets and the disposal of rubbish. Here too was space for a vegetable plot and somewhere to keep animals.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>When the Welshman William Cragh was hanged in 1290, the New Castle was the Swansea home of the de Briouze family. Lord William de Briouze, the son of the Lord William who ordered the hanging, tells us in his witness testimony that he (and his guests) watched the hanging from the windows of the Castle hall. They were able to see the broken crossbeam of the gibbet and William Cragh hanged for a second time. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that she and her maidservants and other companions were in the Castle praying to St Thomas de Cantilupe for Wililam Cragh&rsquo;s life to be spared. We don&rsquo;t know why Mary was so keen for Cragh to be saved.</p>

									<p><p>This delicate silver brooch, decorated with cross-hatched collar knots, is perhaps the kind of ornament which might have been worn by Mary de Briouze, Lady of Swansea Castle in the late 13th century. A wealthy noblewoman, Lady Mary would have had access to (relatively) fine clothes and jewellery. But her life was controlled and restricted and often confined to the Castle.</p></p>
