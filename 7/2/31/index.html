								<p>William Cragh, the Welshman hanged by Lord William de Briouze in 1290, spent the night before his execution here with other condemned men. The castle dungeons were a place of suffering and despair, where criminals and opponents of the Anglo-Norman regime were held. Later, in the 18th century, part of Swansea Castle became a debtors&rsquo; prison. Is this place still haunted by the pleas and moans of the unfortunate individuals who languished here?</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">There are references to the dungeon at the castle in 1322, 1400 and 1535 when it was provided with new locks and keys. Despite this where the dungeon was located in Swansea Castle is not known. A later prison for debtors was established in the square tower set in the defensive wall surrounding the castle. In the medieval period, the view from this tower would have looked over the Strand and the River Tawe to the open fields and hills on the opposite bank. In the 18th century the upper floor of the tower was modified to serve as the debtors&rsquo; prison, re-establishing the centuries-old link between the Castle and the detention of prisoners involved in rebellions such as William Cragh&rsquo;s attack on Swansea and Oystermouth Castles in 1287.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>In the late 13th century, the Strand ran along the River Tawe, where ships unloaded their goods. Swansea&rsquo;s status as a port and trading city is reflected in Welsh poetry, which celebrates the town as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;. But the strand, and the land around it which sloped down to the river, was overlooked by Swansea Castle and the Anglo-Norman lords who controlled the town. The story of the hanging of William Cragh in 1290 shows us how the ruling de Briouze family were able to look out over the surrounding landscape from the castle, helping them to enforce their power and authority.</p>

									<p><p>In the Middle Ages, the Strand ran along the River Tawe and was a bustling place where ships unloaded their wares and moored for repairs. Not all ships made it safely to harbour: this early medieval pot was brought up from a shipwreck by fishing nets in the 19th century. It reflects medieval Swansea&rsquo;s importance as a trading centre and busy sea-port.</p></p>
