								<p>Standing here in the Middle Ages you would have been at the edge of the River Tawe and in the midst of a bustling harbour. But not every ship made it safely into port. The object you can view for this location is an early medieval pot, brought up from a shipwreck by fishing nets in the 19th century. Many boats and seafarers have been lost in the waters around Swansea. Traces of some of these lost souls may well be under your feet right here, deep beneath the earth, where the river once flowed.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Maritime trade was the key to medieval Swansea&rsquo;s prosperity as a town and a port. The place in the town where ships were moored was the Strand, the name meaning beach or shore. The modern road called Strand indicates the medieval line of the banks of the Tawe where ships could be taken out of the river either for unloading or repairs. Goods brought to Swansea by sea would have entered the town through the streets leading up from the Strand. Several narrow alleys still survive, such as Green Dragon Lane, connecting the Strand to the town&rsquo;s main medieval market place in Wind Street. Historical documents and archaeological evidence show that by the 13th century Swansea had a thriving coastal business to areas such as North Devon and ports such as Bristol. Luxury goods such as wine were imported from France for the wealthier members of Swansea&rsquo;s medieval population. Improvements to the river in the 19th century resulted in the creation of the New Cut in 1843 which moved the river to its present course.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On the morning of the execution, William Cragh and Trahaearn ap Hywel, the other condemned man, were led out of the West Gate towards Gibbet Hill. The priest Thomas Marshall tells us that Cragh wore a shirt and breeches; Trahaearn was in a tunic with his hands tied behind his back. Another priest, William Codineston, walked with the condemned men. He tells us that Cragh wanted to make a confession &ndash; but Codineston didn&rsquo;t speak Welsh and couldn&rsquo;t help. William Codineston also tells us that he left the execution posse as it passed through the Gate as he didn&rsquo;t think it was appropriate for him to follow &lsquo;due to his status as a priest&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea could b a dangerous place, where tensions between different groups and individuals could run high. The road to Gower begins from Swansea&rsquo;s West Gate, making it a particularly likely route into Swansea for the Welsh community outside the mainly Anglo-Norman town. This dagger reminds us of the constant dangers of attack, siege and rebellion in medieval Swansea and the marcher lordship of Gower.</p></p>
