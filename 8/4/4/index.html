								<p>At the same time as the area around St Mary&rsquo;s Church was developed, it is likely too that High Street became built-up north of the castle. High Street was the main land route into the town, and led right up to the castle gates and Old Castle. The street was a suburb in the thirteenth century and it extended northwards for some considerable distance. The street was wide and could have been used for trading, and certainly its position as a main route in the town would have meant properties a long it would have been desirable as sites for shops and merchants&rsquo; houses. When High Street was first built up, perhaps in the early-13th century, perhaps earlier, it was not defended, but later, by the 14th century the town&rsquo;s walls cut across High Street at King Street, dividing the suburb in two, creating High Street and Upper High Street. A gate was built across the street too, North Gate.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">High Street was the main road into medieval Swansea from the north. It was an important route and also a long street fronted with houses, some of which stood in the walled town and others outside, in a suburb of the medieval town. North Gate was the divide. This whole area of High Street was probably established in the later 12th&nbsp;century as Swansea prospered and outgrew the area of the earlier Norman town around Wind Street. Despite the major changes Swansea has seen in the past two centuries, it is remarkable that along High Street the remains of some medieval house-plots still survive, even though the buildings themselves have are modern.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>After he was hanged, the body of William Cragh was carried to the house of Thomas Mathews, a burgess (townsman) of Swansea. His body lay here, bloody and disfigured, with his eyes hanging from their sockets and the tongue swollen out of his mouth. Adam of Loughor, aged around 13 at the time, tells us he was too scared to look at the body. And yet, to everyone&rsquo;s amazement, William Cragh began to come back to life. Many witnesses came to see this and Lady Mary de Briouze &ndash; wife of Lord William who had ordered the execution &ndash; sent a maidservant with nourishing almond milk to help Cragh recover. Was it a miracle?</p>

									<p><p>We don&rsquo;t know the exact location of the house of Thomas Mathews in medieval Swansea &ndash; and we don&rsquo;t know who once wore this tiny bronze button. The button could have slipped from the clothing of any reasonably well-to-do citizen of medieval Swansea: it&rsquo;s something quite ordinary and quite small, but which suggests an intimate and direct connection with an unknown man or woman in the medieval past of Swansea and the Gower.</p></p>
