								<p>By the mid-14th century, medieval Swansea had reached its maximum size and remained like this until the 1800s. This does not mean that the urban landscape stopped changing, however. New buildings were constructed after 1300, such as the town walls and gates, New Castle, and St David&rsquo;s Hospital. These were all significant building projects, showing that there was money in Swansea at this time to fund these works, as well as a desire by the lord and the townspeople to use them to show off the status of the town to traders and visitors. St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important medieval landmarks. Now a public house, it is a good place to end the tour of the development of Swansea and reflect on how much the town has changed through the centuries.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important standing medieval buildings. The present Cross Keys pub incorporates parts of a 14th century building that was the hospital of the Blessed David of Swegnar, founded in 1332. Medieval hospitals were religious institutions, and St David&rsquo;s was staffed by six chaplains to provide a home and care for sick and infirm clergy and laymen. The hospital stood in a prominent and important location in the medieval town and the surviving buildings show it was well appointed with residential areas and a communal hall. It had a garden for growing food. From the remains of rubbish disposed there, archaeologists have shown that residents lived very comfortably, enjoying fine imported wines and goods from France, reflecting the wealth and status of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>Running north through the town, the High Street was the main route between Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle and the probable location of the house of Thomas Mathews, near the Chapel of St John. It was in the house of Thomas Mathews that William Cragh&rsquo;s body was laid after the hanging &ndash; and where he gradually revived. Lord William de Briouze&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, made the journey along the High Street repeatedly as he hurried between the Castle and Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to observe and report on the situation. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maids also went back and forth along the High Street with broth and almond milk for the recovering Cragh.</p>

									<p><p>These stones would have been used for grinding corn to mill flour, an important commodity for trade and consumption in medieval Swansea. A Swansea charter in the 12th century gives all burgesses the right to have their own oven for baking bread, although they were not allowed to grind corn in their own houses. This meant that they had to use the lord&rsquo;s mill and pay for the privilege!</p></p>
