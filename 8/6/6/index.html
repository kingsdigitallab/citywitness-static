								<p>By the mid-14th century, medieval Swansea had reached its maximum size and remained like this until the 1800s. This does not mean that the urban landscape stopped changing, however. New buildings were constructed after 1300, such as the town walls and gates, New Castle, and St David&rsquo;s Hospital. These were all significant building projects, showing that there was money in Swansea at this time to fund these works, as well as a desire by the lord and the townspeople to use them to show off the status of the town to traders and visitors. St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important medieval landmarks. Now a public house, it is a good place to end the tour of the development of Swansea and reflect on how much the town has changed through the centuries.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important standing medieval buildings. The present Cross Keys pub incorporates parts of a 14th century building that was the hospital of the Blessed David of Swegnar, founded in 1332. Medieval hospitals were religious institutions, and St David&rsquo;s was staffed by six chaplains to provide a home and care for sick and infirm clergy and laymen. The hospital stood in a prominent and important location in the medieval town and the surviving buildings show it was well appointed with residential areas and a communal hall. It had a garden for growing food. From the remains of rubbish disposed there, archaeologists have shown that residents lived very comfortably, enjoying fine imported wines and goods from France, reflecting the wealth and status of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On the morning of the execution, William Cragh and Trahaearn ap Hywel, the other condemned man, were led out of the West Gate towards Gibbet Hill. The priest Thomas Marshall tells us that Cragh wore a shirt and breeches; Trahaearn was in a tunic with his hands tied behind his back. Another priest, William Codineston, walked with the condemned men. He tells us that Cragh wanted to make a confession &ndash; but Codineston didn&rsquo;t speak Welsh and couldn&rsquo;t help. William Codineston also tells us that he left the execution posse as it passed through the Gate as he didn&rsquo;t think it was appropriate for him to follow &lsquo;due to his status as a priest&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea could b a dangerous place, where tensions between different groups and individuals could run high. The road to Gower begins from Swansea&rsquo;s West Gate, making it a particularly likely route into Swansea for the Welsh community outside the mainly Anglo-Norman town. This dagger reminds us of the constant dangers of attack, siege and rebellion in medieval Swansea and the marcher lordship of Gower.</p></p>
