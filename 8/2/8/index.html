								<p>Old Castle is no longer visible but was the site of Swansea&rsquo;s first castle, built in around 1100. The castle itself was a motte and bailey, covering quite a large site and connected on one side to the market place and Wind Street. The castle was enclosed on all four sides by natural defences, but these were also strengthened by walls and gates. It is possible that the outer part of the castle enclosure, the bailey, was used to control traffic coming into and out of the market place, passing before the lord&rsquo;s eyes. If there was a town at Swansea before the Normans, their castle may have been built upon house-plots and streets, as happened elsewhere at this time, at Norwich for example. By-passing the castle was made possible by using Goat Street, which skirts to the west of the castle, or Strand to the east, avoiding the lord&rsquo;s prying eyes.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Old Castle was the location of Swansea&rsquo;s first castle, founded around 1106. It was a motte and bailey castle, now disappeared from the modern townscape. At the time it was built, the castle would have been seen as a symbol of Norman power in a Welsh landscape. The castle was divided into two parts, known as wards or baileys, with a ditch and timber palisade for the defences and two gates. One gate stood on the north side of the castle, leading to High Street, and the other on the south, adjacent to the later New Castle. The outer ward of Old Castle contained many of the buildings needed for its upkeep. The inner ward was the defensive heart of the castle with its own wall and ditch surrounding an earthen mound (motte) topped by a keep. In 1216 the castle passed into the control of the de Briouze family, and in 1221 John de Briouze repaired and rebuilt the castle in stone. In 1845, the remains of the late 13<span style="font-size: 8px;">th</span>&nbsp;century High Street gate were found and revealed an impressive building with two towers either side of the entrance. In more recent years archaeologists have also found sections of the castle ditch near College Street and in Princess Way.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The parish church for medieval Swansea, St Mary&rsquo;s benefited from the patronage of the de Briouze family. We know that Lady Mary de Briouze &ndash; wife of the Lord William who ordered the hanging of the Welshman William Cragh &ndash; was a religious and devout woman, and we can imagine her visiting St Mary&rsquo;s for services and prayer. While the medieval structure of St Mary&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t survive today, the story of William Cragh also gives us other clues about what might have been there. For example, while Cragh is in the dungeons of Swansea Castle before his hanging, he reports seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary. But he says that she wasn&rsquo;t holding her son, the Christ child, &lsquo;as material images concerning her represent&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s possible that Cragh was thinking of pictures of Mary which he had seen in Swansea&rsquo;s parish church, itself dedicated to her. Wall paintings and statues of Mary were very common in Wales at this time.</p>

									<p><p>This carved stone head was found at the site of the old Rectory House in Fisher Street, Swansea in the late 19th century and is thought to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally believed to depict Alina de Mowbray, daughter of Lord William de Briouze (junior) who testified in 1307 as a witness to the hanging of William Cragh. Alina&rsquo;s own life was colourful and her fortunes very changeable. Today, she is remembered as the ghostly &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo; of Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles.&nbsp;</p></p>
