								<p class="MsoNormal">The medieval chapel of St John was located in an area of open fields on the northern outskirts of the walled town of Swansea. Now the site of St Matthew&rsquo;s church, historical sources indicate that the church was founded by Knights Hospitallers in the 12th century and was associated with a manor they owned. An engraving by Paul Padley from the 1790s shows the earlier church was much smaller, consisting of a simple rectangular building, which would have had a nave and chancel. This engraving also shows that the church was largely surrounded by fields, with a few houses close to the road into Swansea. The present church was built in the 19th&nbsp;century to meet the needs of the growing population of Swansea which saw the fields around the church built over with workers housing.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Wassail Gate was one of the main gates into the walled town of Swansea in the Middle Ages. It was also the start of the road to Gower, where many of the participants in the story of the hanging of William Cragh lived or came from. William Cragh himself was from Llanrhidian, though he tells us that his own lands had been taken away by his lord and he relied on the help of his friends. (Other medieval documents prove that this really did happen &ndash; Cragh had good reason to hate Lord William de Briouze.) As his name suggests, Adam of Loughor probably originally came from Loughor, across the Gower peninsula, near Llanelli.</p>

									<p><p>This characterful fragment of a medieval earthenware jug spout is decorated with a goblin, whose pointed ears stick out at either side of his face. This decoration suggests the humour and playfulness enjoyed by medieval craftspeople and the users of their wares. Just outside Wassail Gate may have been an alternative marketplace for medieval Swansea &ndash; likely the site of occasional festivities &ndash; and the (post-medieval) name &lsquo;Wassail&rsquo; suggests that this Gate may have been associated with merriment and celebration.</p></p>
