								<p>The Anglo-Norman family who ruled Swansea and the Marcher Lordship of Gower had just moved into their new Castle here in 1290. Lord William had ordered the execution of Cragh: he watched events from an upper window and received reports on William&rsquo;s recovery from his steward, John of Baggeham. Meanwhile, Lord William&rsquo;s wife, Lady Mary, prayed in her own chamber for St Thomas de Cantilupe to save William Cragh, having unsuccessfully begged her husband to spare him.&nbsp;</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">New Castle was designed to replace the Old Castle, and work on it started around 1284-90 under the lordship of William de Briouze II. The distinctive arcading seen high up on the standing walls was added by John, Lord of Mowbray (1331-54). Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle reflects a period of relative peace with few raids or wars. Being designed to provide comfortable living and working space, the New Castle had well-appointed private rooms with an inside toilet (latrine) that emptied into the moat. There was also a grand entertainment and business area &ndash; a hall &ndash; located on the first floor with a series of basements below. By this time there is also evidence that housing for wealthier residents of Swansea stood in the outer ward of the castle. This area was cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to expose the ruins of the castle and to create Castle Square.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Swansea&rsquo;s walls and gates, like the East Gate, were a symbol of Anglo-Norman power and authority, and were viewed with mixed feelings by Welsh people. William Cragh was a rebel accused of involvement in the burning of Oystermouth Castle, but we also know that he was active and known in the local town community of Swansea. Medieval Welsh texts give us some glimpses of the conflicting attitudes Welsh people had to Swansea. Swansea is called a &lsquo;town of broken towers&rsquo; where the women are &lsquo;altogether widows&rsquo; as a result of Welsh raids. But the town is also praised as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;.</p>

Women were associated with spinning and weaving throughout the medieval period &ndash; the early English word for &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, &lsquo;wif&rsquo; actually derives from her role as a weaver. Spinning was work which could be undertaken in a domestic setting while a woman ran the home.</span></span></p></p>
