								<p>The Anglo-Norman family who ruled Swansea and the Marcher Lordship of Gower had just moved into their new Castle here in 1290. Lord William had ordered the execution of Cragh: he watched events from an upper window and received reports on William&rsquo;s recovery from his steward, John of Baggeham. Meanwhile, Lord William&rsquo;s wife, Lady Mary, prayed in her own chamber for St Thomas de Cantilupe to save William Cragh, having unsuccessfully begged her husband to spare him.&nbsp;</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">New Castle was designed to replace the Old Castle, and work on it started around 1284-90 under the lordship of William de Briouze II. The distinctive arcading seen high up on the standing walls was added by John, Lord of Mowbray (1331-54). Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle reflects a period of relative peace with few raids or wars. Being designed to provide comfortable living and working space, the New Castle had well-appointed private rooms with an inside toilet (latrine) that emptied into the moat. There was also a grand entertainment and business area &ndash; a hall &ndash; located on the first floor with a series of basements below. By this time there is also evidence that housing for wealthier residents of Swansea stood in the outer ward of the castle. This area was cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to expose the ruins of the castle and to create Castle Square.&nbsp;</p>
