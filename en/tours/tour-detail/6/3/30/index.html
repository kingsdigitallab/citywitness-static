								<p>Swansea&rsquo;s main market place was held at the top of Wind Street. Food, clothes and household items would be traded here. Archaeological finds show that fine imported wine was drunk in Swansea in the Middle Ages. Trade in leather and hides was also an important part of the local economy. At the bottom of Wind Street, the South Gate led out to marshland and a ferry across the Tawe. At the top of the street, the Castle loomed large.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">For medieval Swansea, like all medieval towns, the market place was its commercial core, where traders gathered. The market place in Wind Street is probably the earliest part of medieval Swansea, perhaps laid out at the same time the castle was first built, in around 1100. Its location, beneath the castle, meant it could be watched closely by the Lords of the Gower. By 1300 it was perhaps home to some of its wealthiest residents. Swansea had a weekly market and two yearly fairs, and on other days the market place was used for meetings and street entertainment during religious festivals. Food was one of the main goods sold, as well as clothes and household items. These were sold from stalls and booths which could be set up and taken down on market days.</p>

							<p>Swansea&rsquo;s South Gate led down towards the Cadle stream and the marshy land beyond. Even here, the raised, imposing structure of the Castle would have been visible, showing the power and control of the Anglo-Norman Marcher lords, who acted quickly to crush and punish acts of rebellion such as the burning of Oystermouth Castle, with which William Cragh was involved.</p>

									<p><p>Between the medieval marketplace on Wind Street and the ferry crossing over the Tawe, the South Gate would have been a place where local people and travellers arrived in the city to enjoy trade and hospitality. This jug must once have been at the centre of many convivial scenes, as people in medieval Swansea shared drinks, stories and laughter.</p></p>
