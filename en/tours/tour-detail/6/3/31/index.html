								<p>Swansea&rsquo;s main market place was held at the top of Wind Street. Food, clothes and household items would be traded here. Archaeological finds show that fine imported wine was drunk in Swansea in the Middle Ages. Trade in leather and hides was also an important part of the local economy. At the bottom of Wind Street, the South Gate led out to marshland and a ferry across the Tawe. At the top of the street, the Castle loomed large.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">For medieval Swansea, like all medieval towns, the market place was its commercial core, where traders gathered. The market place in Wind Street is probably the earliest part of medieval Swansea, perhaps laid out at the same time the castle was first built, in around 1100. Its location, beneath the castle, meant it could be watched closely by the Lords of the Gower. By 1300 it was perhaps home to some of its wealthiest residents. Swansea had a weekly market and two yearly fairs, and on other days the market place was used for meetings and street entertainment during religious festivals. Food was one of the main goods sold, as well as clothes and household items. These were sold from stalls and booths which could be set up and taken down on market days.</p>

							<p>In the late 13th century, the Strand ran along the River Tawe, where ships unloaded their goods. Swansea&rsquo;s status as a port and trading city is reflected in Welsh poetry, which celebrates the town as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;. But the strand, and the land around it which sloped down to the river, was overlooked by Swansea Castle and the Anglo-Norman lords who controlled the town. The story of the hanging of William Cragh in 1290 shows us how the ruling de Briouze family were able to look out over the surrounding landscape from the castle, helping them to enforce their power and authority.</p>

									<p><p>In the Middle Ages, the Strand ran along the River Tawe and was a bustling place where ships unloaded their wares and moored for repairs. Not all ships made it safely to harbour: this early medieval pot was brought up from a shipwreck by fishing nets in the 19th century. It reflects medieval Swansea&rsquo;s importance as a trading centre and busy sea-port.</p></p>
