								<p>Swansea&rsquo;s main market place was held at the top of Wind Street. Food, clothes and household items would be traded here. Archaeological finds show that fine imported wine was drunk in Swansea in the Middle Ages. Trade in leather and hides was also an important part of the local economy. At the bottom of Wind Street, the South Gate led out to marshland and a ferry across the Tawe. At the top of the street, the Castle loomed large.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">For medieval Swansea, like all medieval towns, the market place was its commercial core, where traders gathered. The market place in Wind Street is probably the earliest part of medieval Swansea, perhaps laid out at the same time the castle was first built, in around 1100. Its location, beneath the castle, meant it could be watched closely by the Lords of the Gower. By 1300 it was perhaps home to some of its wealthiest residents. Swansea had a weekly market and two yearly fairs, and on other days the market place was used for meetings and street entertainment during religious festivals. Food was one of the main goods sold, as well as clothes and household items. These were sold from stalls and booths which could be set up and taken down on market days.</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On the morning of the execution, William Cragh and Trahaearn ap Hywel, the other condemned man, were led out of the West Gate towards Gibbet Hill. The priest Thomas Marshall tells us that Cragh wore a shirt and breeches; Trahaearn was in a tunic with his hands tied behind his back. Another priest, William Codineston, walked with the condemned men. He tells us that Cragh wanted to make a confession &ndash; but Codineston didn&rsquo;t speak Welsh and couldn&rsquo;t help. William Codineston also tells us that he left the execution posse as it passed through the Gate as he didn&rsquo;t think it was appropriate for him to follow &lsquo;due to his status as a priest&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea could b a dangerous place, where tensions between different groups and individuals could run high. The road to Gower begins from Swansea&rsquo;s West Gate, making it a particularly likely route into Swansea for the Welsh community outside the mainly Anglo-Norman town. This dagger reminds us of the constant dangers of attack, siege and rebellion in medieval Swansea and the marcher lordship of Gower.</p></p>
