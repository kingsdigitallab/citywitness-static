								<p class="MsoNormal">The medieval chapel of St John was located in an area of open fields on the northern outskirts of the walled town of Swansea. Now the site of St Matthew&rsquo;s church, historical sources indicate that the church was founded by Knights Hospitallers in the 12th century and was associated with a manor they owned. An engraving by Paul Padley from the 1790s shows the earlier church was much smaller, consisting of a simple rectangular building, which would have had a nave and chancel. This engraving also shows that the church was largely surrounded by fields, with a few houses close to the road into Swansea. The present church was built in the 19th&nbsp;century to meet the needs of the growing population of Swansea which saw the fields around the church built over with workers housing.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>After William Cragh was hanged, his friends carried his apparently lifeless body to the Chapel of St John. This may have been because the Chapel had a long-standing association with the Welsh community, and it was located outside the town walls. Lady Mary de Briouze tells us that Cragh&rsquo;s body was transported on a kind of wooden wheel, which in itself would have caused great injury. The different medieval witnesses don&rsquo;t agree on what happened when Cragh&rsquo;s body arrived at the Chapel of St John. It seems likely that the Chapel was closed, and Cragh&rsquo;s body was then carried to the nearby house of Thomas Mathews.</p>
