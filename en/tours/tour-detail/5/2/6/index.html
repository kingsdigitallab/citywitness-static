								<p>From here you have a view up to North Hill, known in the Middle Ages as Gibbet Hill, where William Cragh was hanged on an autumn morning in 1290. But the execution went wrong: the crossbeam of the gallows broke and Cragh fell to the ground. He was hauled up again and hanged a second time.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Gibbet Hill was the site of Swansea&rsquo;s place of execution, for hangings. Now called North Hill, until the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century the name Gibbet Hill was used, while Gallows Road, now known as North Hill Road, led to the gibbet from the town. The exact position of the medieval gibbet &ndash; or gallows &ndash; is uncertain, but most likely it stood on the edge of the hill, facing the town, so standing out against the sky line when viewed from Swansea beneath. This position on the edge of the town was typical for medieval places of execution and judgement, and made a hanging all the more a public spectacle as prisoners were led from the prison in the Castle through the streets to Gibbet Hill.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>On the morning of the execution, William Cragh and Trahaearn ap Hywel, the other condemned man, were led out of the West Gate towards Gibbet Hill. The priest Thomas Marshall tells us that Cragh wore a shirt and breeches; Trahaearn was in a tunic with his hands tied behind his back. Another priest, William Codineston, walked with the condemned men. He tells us that Cragh wanted to make a confession &ndash; but Codineston didn&rsquo;t speak Welsh and couldn&rsquo;t help. William Codineston also tells us that he left the execution posse as it passed through the Gate as he didn&rsquo;t think it was appropriate for him to follow &lsquo;due to his status as a priest&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea could b a dangerous place, where tensions between different groups and individuals could run high. The road to Gower begins from Swansea&rsquo;s West Gate, making it a particularly likely route into Swansea for the Welsh community outside the mainly Anglo-Norman town. This dagger reminds us of the constant dangers of attack, siege and rebellion in medieval Swansea and the marcher lordship of Gower.</p></p>
