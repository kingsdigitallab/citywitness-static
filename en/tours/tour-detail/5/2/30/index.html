								<p>From here you have a view up to North Hill, known in the Middle Ages as Gibbet Hill, where William Cragh was hanged on an autumn morning in 1290. But the execution went wrong: the crossbeam of the gallows broke and Cragh fell to the ground. He was hauled up again and hanged a second time.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Gibbet Hill was the site of Swansea&rsquo;s place of execution, for hangings. Now called North Hill, until the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century the name Gibbet Hill was used, while Gallows Road, now known as North Hill Road, led to the gibbet from the town. The exact position of the medieval gibbet &ndash; or gallows &ndash; is uncertain, but most likely it stood on the edge of the hill, facing the town, so standing out against the sky line when viewed from Swansea beneath. This position on the edge of the town was typical for medieval places of execution and judgement, and made a hanging all the more a public spectacle as prisoners were led from the prison in the Castle through the streets to Gibbet Hill.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>Swansea&rsquo;s South Gate led down towards the Cadle stream and the marshy land beyond. Even here, the raised, imposing structure of the Castle would have been visible, showing the power and control of the Anglo-Norman Marcher lords, who acted quickly to crush and punish acts of rebellion such as the burning of Oystermouth Castle, with which William Cragh was involved.</p>

									<p><p>Between the medieval marketplace on Wind Street and the ferry crossing over the Tawe, the South Gate would have been a place where local people and travellers arrived in the city to enjoy trade and hospitality. This jug must once have been at the centre of many convivial scenes, as people in medieval Swansea shared drinks, stories and laughter.</p></p>
