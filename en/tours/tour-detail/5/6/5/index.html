								<p>St Mary&rsquo;s was the parish church for medieval Swansea and the centre of the town&rsquo;s religious life. Prayers and thanks for Cragh&rsquo;s recovery would have been offered here. After Cragh was restored to health, he went with Lord and Lady de Briouze on pilgrimage to St Thomas de Cantilupe&rsquo;s shrine at Hereford. They took a wax model of a hanged man as an offering to St Thomas, and Cragh walked the whole way barefoot. Then, Cragh promised to go to the Holy Land. However, a few years later, he was at large in Swansea again&hellip;</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">The church of St Mary was the parish church for medieval Swansea. It was first recorded in 1291 but was probably built originally in the 12th century when this part of the town was first developed. The building has changed much over the centuries, which means little is known about its appearance in the Middle Ages. The church was rebuilt in 1739, although the tower and side chapel of the older church was retained. Elements of the medieval church were recorded and showed evidence of mid-late 13th century architecture prior to its rebuilding between 1895 and 1899. St Mary&rsquo;s was badly damaged in the Second World War, destroying the remaining medieval fabric. The new church was built between 1954-59, with only the stone effigy of a priest and the 15th century tomb brass to Sir Hugh Johnys and his wife as a link to its medieval past.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>William Cragh was held in the dungeons of Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle before he was led to Gibbet Hill to be hanged. While in the dungeons, he tells us that he had a vision of a man robed in white, whom he believed to be St Thomas de Cantilupe. He also saw a vision of the Virgin Mary, who gave him a sign that he would be saved. While in the dungeon, Cragh &lsquo;bent a penny to St Thomas&rsquo; &ndash; a way of asking for the saint&rsquo;s help and promising to honour him if he was spared.</p>

									<p><p>Waiting in the dungeons, the night before his execution, William Cragh tells us that he &lsquo;bent a penny&rsquo; to St Thomas. This folk custom involved bending or folding a coin to invoke a saint and their help. This coin, from the reign of Edward I, recalls the secret ritual practised by Cragh &ndash; which may perhaps have saved his life&hellip;</p></p>
