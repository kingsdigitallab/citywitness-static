								<p class="p1">Wind Street curves around in an arc and is broad to accommodate medieval Swansea&rsquo;s market. The street may represent the earliest phase of urban development. On east side of the street house plots stretched back to the river and on the west to a ditch, possibly the town&rsquo;s earliest medieval defences linked with the castle. One interpretation of Wind Street and the market is to see it as a late-11th or early-12th century piece of town planning linked to the creation of Old Castle to the north. The castle and town together were a hallmark of Norman colonisation and urban development in Wales and England. A second interpretation of Wind Street is to see it as an area that existed before the Normans. If so, then the possibility exists that the curved Wind Street was originally longer and perhaps even originated at the time of the Vikings.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">For medieval Swansea, like all medieval towns, the market place was its commercial core, where traders gathered. The market place in Wind Street is probably the earliest part of medieval Swansea, perhaps laid out at the same time the castle was first built, in around 1100. Its location, beneath the castle, meant it could be watched closely by the Lords of the Gower. By 1300 it was perhaps home to some of its wealthiest residents. Swansea had a weekly market and two yearly fairs, and on other days the market place was used for meetings and street entertainment during religious festivals. Food was one of the main goods sold, as well as clothes and household items. These were sold from stalls and booths which could be set up and taken down on market days.</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Swansea&rsquo;s walls and gates, like the East Gate, were a symbol of Anglo-Norman power and authority, and were viewed with mixed feelings by Welsh people. William Cragh was a rebel accused of involvement in the burning of Oystermouth Castle, but we also know that he was active and known in the local town community of Swansea. Medieval Welsh texts give us some glimpses of the conflicting attitudes Welsh people had to Swansea. Swansea is called a &lsquo;town of broken towers&rsquo; where the women are &lsquo;altogether widows&rsquo; as a result of Welsh raids. But the town is also praised as &lsquo;fair mother of ships&rsquo;.</p>

									<p><p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 15px;">This small stone loom weight reminds us that women and their work were an important part of the medieval town. Women were associated with spinning and weaving throughout the medieval period &ndash; the early English word for &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, &lsquo;wif&rsquo; actually derives from her role as a weaver. Spinning was work which could be undertaken in a domestic setting while a woman ran the home.</span></span></p></p>
