								<p class="p1">Wind Street curves around in an arc and is broad to accommodate medieval Swansea&rsquo;s market. The street may represent the earliest phase of urban development. On east side of the street house plots stretched back to the river and on the west to a ditch, possibly the town&rsquo;s earliest medieval defences linked with the castle. One interpretation of Wind Street and the market is to see it as a late-11th or early-12th century piece of town planning linked to the creation of Old Castle to the north. The castle and town together were a hallmark of Norman colonisation and urban development in Wales and England. A second interpretation of Wind Street is to see it as an area that existed before the Normans. If so, then the possibility exists that the curved Wind Street was originally longer and perhaps even originated at the time of the Vikings.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">For medieval Swansea, like all medieval towns, the market place was its commercial core, where traders gathered. The market place in Wind Street is probably the earliest part of medieval Swansea, perhaps laid out at the same time the castle was first built, in around 1100. Its location, beneath the castle, meant it could be watched closely by the Lords of the Gower. By 1300 it was perhaps home to some of its wealthiest residents. Swansea had a weekly market and two yearly fairs, and on other days the market place was used for meetings and street entertainment during religious festivals. Food was one of the main goods sold, as well as clothes and household items. These were sold from stalls and booths which could be set up and taken down on market days.</p>
