								<p>By the mid-14th century, medieval Swansea had reached its maximum size and remained like this until the 1800s. This does not mean that the urban landscape stopped changing, however. New buildings were constructed after 1300, such as the town walls and gates, New Castle, and St David&rsquo;s Hospital. These were all significant building projects, showing that there was money in Swansea at this time to fund these works, as well as a desire by the lord and the townspeople to use them to show off the status of the town to traders and visitors. St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important medieval landmarks. Now a public house, it is a good place to end the tour of the development of Swansea and reflect on how much the town has changed through the centuries.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">St David&rsquo;s Hospital is one of Swansea&rsquo;s most important standing medieval buildings. The present Cross Keys pub incorporates parts of a 14th century building that was the hospital of the Blessed David of Swegnar, founded in 1332. Medieval hospitals were religious institutions, and St David&rsquo;s was staffed by six chaplains to provide a home and care for sick and infirm clergy and laymen. The hospital stood in a prominent and important location in the medieval town and the surviving buildings show it was well appointed with residential areas and a communal hall. It had a garden for growing food. From the remains of rubbish disposed there, archaeologists have shown that residents lived very comfortably, enjoying fine imported wines and goods from France, reflecting the wealth and status of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>After he was hanged, the body of William Cragh was carried to the house of Thomas Mathews, a burgess (townsman) of Swansea. His body lay here, bloody and disfigured, with his eyes hanging from their sockets and the tongue swollen out of his mouth. Adam of Loughor, aged around 13 at the time, tells us he was too scared to look at the body. And yet, to everyone&rsquo;s amazement, William Cragh began to come back to life. Many witnesses came to see this and Lady Mary de Briouze &ndash; wife of Lord William who had ordered the execution &ndash; sent a maidservant with nourishing almond milk to help Cragh recover. Was it a miracle?</p>

									<p><p>We don&rsquo;t know the exact location of the house of Thomas Mathews in medieval Swansea &ndash; and we don&rsquo;t know who once wore this tiny bronze button. The button could have slipped from the clothing of any reasonably well-to-do citizen of medieval Swansea: it&rsquo;s something quite ordinary and quite small, but which suggests an intimate and direct connection with an unknown man or woman in the medieval past of Swansea and the Gower.</p></p>
