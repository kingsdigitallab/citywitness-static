								<p>After the creation of the Norman castle town in around 1100, a second phase of development took place to the west, around St Mary&rsquo;s church. This new area was probably created in the late-12th or 13th centuries, and is a sign that Swansea was prosperous as a town at that time and required more space for its townspeople. The creation of Cross Street, Frog Street, Fisher Street and St Mary&rsquo;s Street added a new area equivalent at least to Wind Street, doubling the capacity of this part of the town to take in more traders, merchants and craftspeople. The streets form a cross-plan, another piece of medieval town-planning in Swansea. This probably occurred when St Mary&rsquo;s was built to become the town&rsquo;s parish church. This new area made the old defences around Wind Street redundant, and a new set of defences were begun to the south of Fisher Street, which were later extended northwards with the building of the town walls.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">The church of St Mary was the parish church for medieval Swansea. It was first recorded in 1291 but was probably built originally in the 12th century when this part of the town was first developed. The building has changed much over the centuries, which means little is known about its appearance in the Middle Ages. The church was rebuilt in 1739, although the tower and side chapel of the older church was retained. Elements of the medieval church were recorded and showed evidence of mid-late 13th century architecture prior to its rebuilding between 1895 and 1899. St Mary&rsquo;s was badly damaged in the Second World War, destroying the remaining medieval fabric. The new church was built between 1954-59, with only the stone effigy of a priest and the 15th century tomb brass to Sir Hugh Johnys and his wife as a link to its medieval past.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Wassail Gate was one of the main gates into the walled town of Swansea in the Middle Ages. It was also the start of the road to Gower, where many of the participants in the story of the hanging of William Cragh lived or came from. William Cragh himself was from Llanrhidian, though he tells us that his own lands had been taken away by his lord and he relied on the help of his friends. (Other medieval documents prove that this really did happen &ndash; Cragh had good reason to hate Lord William de Briouze.) As his name suggests, Adam of Loughor probably originally came from Loughor, across the Gower peninsula, near Llanelli.</p>

									<p><p>This characterful fragment of a medieval earthenware jug spout is decorated with a goblin, whose pointed ears stick out at either side of his face. This decoration suggests the humour and playfulness enjoyed by medieval craftspeople and the users of their wares. Just outside Wassail Gate may have been an alternative marketplace for medieval Swansea &ndash; likely the site of occasional festivities &ndash; and the (post-medieval) name &lsquo;Wassail&rsquo; suggests that this Gate may have been associated with merriment and celebration.</p></p>
