								<p>After the creation of the Norman castle town in around 1100, a second phase of development took place to the west, around St Mary&rsquo;s church. This new area was probably created in the late-12th or 13th centuries, and is a sign that Swansea was prosperous as a town at that time and required more space for its townspeople. The creation of Cross Street, Frog Street, Fisher Street and St Mary&rsquo;s Street added a new area equivalent at least to Wind Street, doubling the capacity of this part of the town to take in more traders, merchants and craftspeople. The streets form a cross-plan, another piece of medieval town-planning in Swansea. This probably occurred when St Mary&rsquo;s was built to become the town&rsquo;s parish church. This new area made the old defences around Wind Street redundant, and a new set of defences were begun to the south of Fisher Street, which were later extended northwards with the building of the town walls.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">The church of St Mary was the parish church for medieval Swansea. It was first recorded in 1291 but was probably built originally in the 12th century when this part of the town was first developed. The building has changed much over the centuries, which means little is known about its appearance in the Middle Ages. The church was rebuilt in 1739, although the tower and side chapel of the older church was retained. Elements of the medieval church were recorded and showed evidence of mid-late 13th century architecture prior to its rebuilding between 1895 and 1899. St Mary&rsquo;s was badly damaged in the Second World War, destroying the remaining medieval fabric. The new church was built between 1954-59, with only the stone effigy of a priest and the 15th century tomb brass to Sir Hugh Johnys and his wife as a link to its medieval past.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>The Hospital of St David was founded after the hanging of William Cragh, in 1332 (Cragh was hanged in 1290). But the values of the Hospital reflect medieval traditions of charity, alms-giving and care for the sick and poor which we also glimpse in the story of William Cragh. Lady Mary de Briouze, wife of the Lord William who orders Cragh&rsquo;s execution, performs acts of charity often associated with medieval noblewomen by sending almond milk and broth to help nourish Cragh after the hanging. There&rsquo;s a fascinating tension here between Mary&rsquo;s duty to support her husband&rsquo;s rule as Marcher lord, and her Christian obligation to support the vulnerable members of Swansea&rsquo;s community.</p>
