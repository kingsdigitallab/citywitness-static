								<p>Swansea had town walls by the middle of the 14th century, built of stone, at least for a part of their length, with gates for the streets in and out. The town walls were not built around the whole of the town but just for the part immediately around the castle area, as if the town walls were really a way of creating an outer set of defences for the New Castle that was also being built at this time (to replace the Old Castle). The town walls cut through High Street, and ran behind house-plots in Goat Street, then along the side of St Mary&rsquo;s Church, to link up with the town ditch that was created to defend the area of Frog Street and Fisher Street to the south. The town gates have all gone, but from archaeological research and by studying the town&rsquo;s street pattern it is possible to work out where the gates were, as well as the circuit of the walls.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">Medieval Swansea was a walled town. The line of walls is in part recalled by the name Whitewalls and ran on the western (inland) side of the town connecting West Gate and Wassail Gate. The walls here were made of stone. Historical documents refer to a tax in 1317 for the upkeep of the walls while archaeology has shown that the stone defences may be contemporary with the rebuilding of the castle in the late 13th&nbsp;century. At the corner of Whitewalls and St Mary&rsquo;s Square, the wall was shown to be 1.9 metres thick, faced with sandstone blocks. In front of the wall was a ditch about 6 metres wide and 2 metres deep. The line of the defences around the town can be followed by walking along the street still called Whitewalls.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>The North Gate was in the town walls on Swansea&rsquo;s High Street, and many of the witnesses to the William Cragh story passed through the Gate as they moved between key locations. Lord William&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, goes through the Gate repeatedly as he visits Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to see Cragh&rsquo;s body and reports back to his master in the Castle. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maidservants, Jovanta or Sunehild, also pass through the North Gate on their way to take almond milk to the recovering William Cragh.</p>

									<p><p>This impressive sword speaks of the ever-present reality of violence in medieval Swansea. The North Gate was a point where entry to the walled town was controlled, serving to protect the city against attack. John of Baggeham, steward of William de Briouze in 1290, tells us how he and a band of other men carry arms with them to ensure that the power of the Anglo-Norman lord is enforced and the town is kept under control.</p></p>
