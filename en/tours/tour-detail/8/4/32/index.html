								<p>At the same time as the area around St Mary&rsquo;s Church was developed, it is likely too that High Street became built-up north of the castle. High Street was the main land route into the town, and led right up to the castle gates and Old Castle. The street was a suburb in the thirteenth century and it extended northwards for some considerable distance. The street was wide and could have been used for trading, and certainly its position as a main route in the town would have meant properties a long it would have been desirable as sites for shops and merchants&rsquo; houses. When High Street was first built up, perhaps in the early-13th century, perhaps earlier, it was not defended, but later, by the 14th century the town&rsquo;s walls cut across High Street at King Street, dividing the suburb in two, creating High Street and Upper High Street. A gate was built across the street too, North Gate.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">High Street was the main road into medieval Swansea from the north. It was an important route and also a long street fronted with houses, some of which stood in the walled town and others outside, in a suburb of the medieval town. North Gate was the divide. This whole area of High Street was probably established in the later 12th&nbsp;century as Swansea prospered and outgrew the area of the earlier Norman town around Wind Street. Despite the major changes Swansea has seen in the past two centuries, it is remarkable that along High Street the remains of some medieval house-plots still survive, even though the buildings themselves have are modern.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Wassail Gate was one of the main gates into the walled town of Swansea in the Middle Ages. It was also the start of the road to Gower, where many of the participants in the story of the hanging of William Cragh lived or came from. William Cragh himself was from Llanrhidian, though he tells us that his own lands had been taken away by his lord and he relied on the help of his friends. (Other medieval documents prove that this really did happen &ndash; Cragh had good reason to hate Lord William de Briouze.) As his name suggests, Adam of Loughor probably originally came from Loughor, across the Gower peninsula, near Llanelli.</p>

									<p><p>This characterful fragment of a medieval earthenware jug spout is decorated with a goblin, whose pointed ears stick out at either side of his face. This decoration suggests the humour and playfulness enjoyed by medieval craftspeople and the users of their wares. Just outside Wassail Gate may have been an alternative marketplace for medieval Swansea &ndash; likely the site of occasional festivities &ndash; and the (post-medieval) name &lsquo;Wassail&rsquo; suggests that this Gate may have been associated with merriment and celebration.</p></p>
