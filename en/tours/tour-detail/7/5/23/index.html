								<p>The North Gate was one of the points where entry into medieval Swansea was controlled. Swords, daggers and cannon balls found in Swansea remind us of its violent past. Many people met a bloody end here in the Middle Ages. Medieval Welsh poetry calls Swansea a &lsquo;town of broken towers&rsquo; where the women are &lsquo;altogether widows&rsquo; as a result of Welsh raids.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">North Gate stood on High Street guarding the main entrance into the town from the north. The gate no longer stands but the line of the town walls here is preserved in the alignment of Morris Lane and King Street. Archaeologists working here discovered parts of the medieval town-ditch which showed it to be 10m wide and 3 metres deep. North Gate controlled access into and out of the town, and divided those inside the walled town from those outside, in the suburbs beyond the wall, known in historical documents as Above Town.&nbsp;</p>
