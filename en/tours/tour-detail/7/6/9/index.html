								<p>In 1290, the house of Thomas Mathews was near the Chapel of St John. &lsquo;Thomas Mathews&rsquo; is just one of the names of ordinary inhabitants of Swansea which survive in medieval charters and other documents. It was to Thomas&rsquo;s house that the body of William Cragh was brought after his hanging in 1290 &ndash; other than that, we know nothing about him. The object linked to this location is a medieval bronze button. Again, this tiny everyday item connects us to the anonymous individual who once wore it: an &lsquo;unknown citizen&rsquo; of medieval Gower who stands for all those who lived out their lives here, and whose stories whisper to us across the centuries.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">The medieval chapel of St John was located in an area of open fields on the northern outskirts of the walled town of Swansea. Now the site of St Matthew&rsquo;s church, historical sources indicate that the church was founded by Knights Hospitallers in the 12th century and was associated with a manor they owned. An engraving by Paul Padley from the 1790s shows the earlier church was much smaller, consisting of a simple rectangular building, which would have had a nave and chancel. This engraving also shows that the church was largely surrounded by fields, with a few houses close to the road into Swansea. The present church was built in the 19th&nbsp;century to meet the needs of the growing population of Swansea which saw the fields around the church built over with workers housing.&nbsp;</p>
