								<p>In 1290, the house of Thomas Mathews was near the Chapel of St John. &lsquo;Thomas Mathews&rsquo; is just one of the names of ordinary inhabitants of Swansea which survive in medieval charters and other documents. It was to Thomas&rsquo;s house that the body of William Cragh was brought after his hanging in 1290 &ndash; other than that, we know nothing about him. The object linked to this location is a medieval bronze button. Again, this tiny everyday item connects us to the anonymous individual who once wore it: an &lsquo;unknown citizen&rsquo; of medieval Gower who stands for all those who lived out their lives here, and whose stories whisper to us across the centuries.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">The medieval chapel of St John was located in an area of open fields on the northern outskirts of the walled town of Swansea. Now the site of St Matthew&rsquo;s church, historical sources indicate that the church was founded by Knights Hospitallers in the 12th century and was associated with a manor they owned. An engraving by Paul Padley from the 1790s shows the earlier church was much smaller, consisting of a simple rectangular building, which would have had a nave and chancel. This engraving also shows that the church was largely surrounded by fields, with a few houses close to the road into Swansea. The present church was built in the 19th&nbsp;century to meet the needs of the growing population of Swansea which saw the fields around the church built over with workers housing.&nbsp;</p>

						<div id="crag-panel" class="content">
							<p>Running north through the town, the High Street was the main route between Swansea&rsquo;s New Castle and the probable location of the house of Thomas Mathews, near the Chapel of St John. It was in the house of Thomas Mathews that William Cragh&rsquo;s body was laid after the hanging &ndash; and where he gradually revived. Lord William de Briouze&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, made the journey along the High Street repeatedly as he hurried between the Castle and Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to observe and report on the situation. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maids also went back and forth along the High Street with broth and almond milk for the recovering Cragh.</p>

									<p><p>These stones would have been used for grinding corn to mill flour, an important commodity for trade and consumption in medieval Swansea. A Swansea charter in the 12th century gives all burgesses the right to have their own oven for baking bread, although they were not allowed to grind corn in their own houses. This meant that they had to use the lord&rsquo;s mill and pay for the privilege!</p></p>
