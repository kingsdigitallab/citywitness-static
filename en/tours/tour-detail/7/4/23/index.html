								<p>Standing here in the Middle Ages you would have been at the edge of the River Tawe and in the midst of a bustling harbour. But not every ship made it safely into port. The object you can view for this location is an early medieval pot, brought up from a shipwreck by fishing nets in the 19th century. Many boats and seafarers have been lost in the waters around Swansea. Traces of some of these lost souls may well be under your feet right here, deep beneath the earth, where the river once flowed.</p>

							<div id="about-panel" class="content">
								<p class="MsoNormal">Maritime trade was the key to medieval Swansea&rsquo;s prosperity as a town and a port. The place in the town where ships were moored was the Strand, the name meaning beach or shore. The modern road called Strand indicates the medieval line of the banks of the Tawe where ships could be taken out of the river either for unloading or repairs. Goods brought to Swansea by sea would have entered the town through the streets leading up from the Strand. Several narrow alleys still survive, such as Green Dragon Lane, connecting the Strand to the town&rsquo;s main medieval market place in Wind Street. Historical documents and archaeological evidence show that by the 13th century Swansea had a thriving coastal business to areas such as North Devon and ports such as Bristol. Luxury goods such as wine were imported from France for the wealthier members of Swansea&rsquo;s medieval population. Improvements to the river in the 19th century resulted in the creation of the New Cut in 1843 which moved the river to its present course.&nbsp;</p>
