								<p>A carved stone head was discovered near here in the late 19th century, and is believed to come from the medieval St Mary&rsquo;s Church. It is traditionally held to depict Lady Alina de Mowbray, daughter of William de Briouze, Lord of Gower, who was born in the late 13th century and died in 1331. Alina was married to John de Mowbray, whose right to rule Gower was contested. John took part in the rebellion of Thomas of Lancaster and was hanged. Legend tells that Alina escaped from Gower by boat to Ilfracombe, but she too was taken to the Tower of London. Eventually, Alina did win the right to possession of the Gower for herself and her heirs, but it had been a hard-won victory. Today, Lady Alina&rsquo;s ghost is said to haunt Oystermouth Castle in Mumbles, where she is known as the &lsquo;White Lady&rsquo;.</p>

								<p class="MsoNormal">The church of St Mary was the parish church for medieval Swansea. It was first recorded in 1291 but was probably built originally in the 12th century when this part of the town was first developed. The building has changed much over the centuries, which means little is known about its appearance in the Middle Ages. The church was rebuilt in 1739, although the tower and side chapel of the older church was retained. Elements of the medieval church were recorded and showed evidence of mid-late 13th century architecture prior to its rebuilding between 1895 and 1899. St Mary&rsquo;s was badly damaged in the Second World War, destroying the remaining medieval fabric. The new church was built between 1954-59, with only the stone effigy of a priest and the 15th century tomb brass to Sir Hugh Johnys and his wife as a link to its medieval past.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>Adam of Loughor was a 13-year-old boy in 1290, when the Welsh rebel William Cragh was hanged in Swansea. Interviewed by representatives of the pope years later, Adam remembers that he sat on Swansea&rsquo;s town walls to get a good view of the hanging. Adam&rsquo;s story reminds us that executions served as popular spectacle in the Middle Ages &ndash; a tense and complex mix of entertainment and reminder of the lord&rsquo;s power and vengeance. Although Adam sought out the walls as a good vantage-point to watch the hanging, he wasn&rsquo;t so happy about seeing Cragh&rsquo;s dead body close up. He tells us that, later, he was too scared to look at Cragh&rsquo;s bloodied corpse when it lay in the house of Thomas Mathews.</p>

									<p><p>Medieval Swansea was often under siege. This cannon ball reminds us of the many attacks which the town walls had to withstand, and their important role in protecting the town&rsquo;s inhabitants. Tradition holds that this particular cannon ball was used later, in Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s attack on Swansea Castle in the Civil War (1648).&nbsp;</p></p>
