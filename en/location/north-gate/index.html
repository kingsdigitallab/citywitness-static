			<h1>King&#39;s Lane, Morris Lane and High Street junction  (Formerly North Gate)</h1>
                        <p><p>At the North Gate, the junction of High Street, Morris Lane and King's Lane marked the northern-most limit of the walled medieval town.</p></p>
                    <p><p class="MsoNormal">North Gate stood on High Street guarding the main entrance into the town from the north. The gate no longer stands but the line of the town walls here is preserved in the alignment of Morris Lane and King Street. Archaeologists working here discovered parts of the medieval town-ditch which showed it to be 10m wide and 3 metres deep. North Gate controlled access into and out of the town, and divided those inside the walled town from those outside, in the suburbs beyond the wall, known in historical documents as Above Town.&nbsp;</p></p>
            <p><p>The North Gate was in the town walls on Swansea&rsquo;s High Street, and many of the witnesses to the William Cragh story passed through the Gate as they moved between key locations. Lord William&rsquo;s steward, John of Baggeham, goes through the Gate repeatedly as he visits Thomas Mathews&rsquo; house to see Cragh&rsquo;s body and reports back to his master in the Castle. Lady Mary&rsquo;s maidservants, Jovanta or Sunehild, also pass through the North Gate on their way to take almond milk to the recovering William Cragh.</p></p>
