			<h1>Old Castle </h1>
                        <p><p>This is the site of Swansea's earliest Castle.</p></p>
                    <p><p class="MsoNormal">Old Castle was the location of Swansea&rsquo;s first castle, founded around 1106. It was a motte and bailey castle, now disappeared from the modern townscape. At the time it was built, the castle would have been seen as a symbol of Norman power in a Welsh landscape. The castle was divided into two parts, known as wards or baileys, with a ditch and timber palisade for the defences and two gates. One gate stood on the north side of the castle, leading to High Street, and the other on the south, adjacent to the later New Castle. The outer ward of Old Castle contained many of the buildings needed for its upkeep. The inner ward was the defensive heart of the castle with its own wall and ditch surrounding an earthen mound (motte) topped by a keep. In 1216 the castle passed into the control of the de Briouze family, and in 1221 John de Briouze repaired and rebuilt the castle in stone. In 1845, the remains of the late 13<span style="font-size: 8px;">th</span>&nbsp;century High Street gate were found and revealed an impressive building with two towers either side of the entrance. In more recent years archaeologists have also found sections of the castle ditch near College Street and in Princess Way.&nbsp;</p></p>
            <p><p>At the time of the hanging of William Cragh in 1290, the de Briouze family had moved to the New Castle in Swansea (although they preferred to stay at Oystermouth Castle, in modern-day Mumbles). The castles were a symbol of Anglo-Norman power and a target for attacks by Welsh fighters such as William Cragh. The entry for 1113 in the Welsh Chronicle, Brut y Tywysogion, tells how Welsh warriors attacked Swansea&rsquo;s Old Castle &lsquo;and burnt the environs but could not destroy it, only ravaging the land of Gower&rsquo;. William Cragh was hanged for his part in continuing Welsh rebellions against Anglo-Norman rule.</p></p>
